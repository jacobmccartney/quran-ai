"Abu Bakr bought a saddle from ‘Azib for thirteen dirhams, then Abu Bakr said to 'Azib. Tell al-Bara to carry it to my house. He said: No, not until you tell us what happened when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out and you were with him. Abu Bakr said: We started our journey at the beginning of the night and we hastened for one day and one night, until it was midday. I looked into the distance to see whether there was anywhere to seek shade, and I saw a rock, so I went to it and it had a little shade. I smoothed the ground for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and spread a garment of camel hair for him, and said: Lie down and rest, O Messenger of Allah. So he lay down, and I went out to see if I could spot anyone looking for us. Then I saw a shepherd and I said: Who do you belong to, O boy? He said: To a man of Quraish. He mentioned his name and I recognised it. I said: Is there any milk in your sheep? He said: Yes | said: Will you milk some for me? He said: Yes. I told him to do that, so he caught a sheep, then I told him to brush the dust from its teat, then to brush the dust off his hands. I had a small vessel with me on the neck of which was a cloth. He milked a little bit of milk for me and I poured it into the vessel until it cooled down. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When I reached him, he had already woken up. I said: Drink, O Messenger of Allah. He drank until I was pleased, then I said: Is it time to move on? So we moved on and the people were coming after us but none of them caught up with us except Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju'shum, who was riding a horse of his, I said: O Messenger of Allah, someone has caught up with us. He said: `Do not be afraid, for Allah is with us.` When he got close to us, and there was no more between us and him then the length of a spear or two or three spears, I said: O Messenger of Allah, this pursuer has caught up with us, and I wept. He said: `Why are you weeping?` I said: I am not weeping for myself; rather I am weeping for you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed against him [the pursuer] and said: “O Allah, protect us from him by whatever means You will.” Then his horse's legs sank into the solid ground up to its belly, and he fell off it. He said: O Muhammad, I know that this is because of you; pray to Allah to save me from my predicament, and by Allah I shall divert away from you any one who is behind me of those who are seeking you. Here is my quiver, take one arrow. You are going to pass by some camels and sheep of mine in such and such a place, take whatever you need from thern. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `I have no need of it.“ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed for him and he was released, and he went back to his companions. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and I continued on our way until we came to Madinah, where the people met him. They came out on the road and on the roofs, and a lot of servants and children crowded the road saying: Allahu Akbar, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has come, Muhammad has come. The people disputed as to who he would stay with. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Tonight I will stay with Banun-Najjar, the maternal uncles of 'Abdul-Muttalib, to honour them thereby.” The next morning, he went where he was instructed. Al-Bara' bin 'Azib said: The first of the Muhajireen to come to us was Mus'ab bin 'Umair, the brother of Banu 'Abdud-Dar. Then Ibn Umm Maktoom, the blind man and brother of Banu Fihr, came to us. Then 'Umar bin al-Khattab, came to us with twenty riders and we said: What happened to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? He said: He is behind me. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came and Abu Bakr was with him. Al-Bara said: the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not come until I had read some soorahs from al-Mufassal [Al-Mufassal is that portion of the Qur'an which goes from Qaf to an-Nas].

He went around doing that for three days, then [the Prophet (ﷺ) said to ‘Ali; “Go and catch up with him; send Abu Bakr back to me and you convey it.” So he did that.

Then he sat where he was until he had prayed Zuhr, 'Asr and Maghrib, and he did not speak until he had prayed 'isha'. Then he got up and went to his family. The people said to Abu Bakr: Why don't you ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) what is the matter? He did something today that he never did before. So he asked him and he said: `Yes, I was shown what is to come of this world and the Hereafter. The earlier and later generations were gathered in one place and the people got terrified because of that. They went to Adam when the sweat was about to reach their mouths, and they said: O Adam, you are the father of mankind and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose you. Intercede for us with your Lord, He said: I am in the same position as you. Go to your father after your father, to Nooh, “Allah chose Adam, Nooh (Noah), the family of Ibraheem (Abraham) and the family of 'Imran above the 'Alameen (mankind and jinn) (of their times)` (Al 'Imran 3:33}.

Then they will go to Nooh and will say: Intercede with your Lord for us, for Allah chose you and answered your supplication, and He did not leave one of the disbelievers on the Earth (cf. 71:26). He will say: I am not the one you want; go to Ibraheem for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, took him as a close friend (khaleel). So they will go to Ibraheem but he will say: I am not the one you want; go to Moosa, for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, spoke directly to him (cf. 4:164). But Moosa will say: I am not the one you want; go to 'Eesa Ibn Maryam, for he healed those born blind and the lepers, and he brought forth the dead. But 'Eesa will say: I am not the one you want; go to the leader of the sons of Adam, for he is the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection. Go to Muhammad, for he will intercede for you with your Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. Then (the Prophet) will go and Jibreel will come to his Lord and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Give him permission and give him the glad tidings of Paradise. Jibreel will take him and he will fall down in prostration for a week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intercession will be accepted. So he will raise his head, and when he looks at his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, he will fall down in prostration for another week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intersession will be accepted. He will start to fall down in prostration again, but Jibreel (peace be upon him) will take hold of his upper arms and Allah, may he be glorified and exalted, will inspire him to offer a supplication such as no human being was ever inspired with. He will say: `O Lord, You created me as the leader of the sons of Adam, and no boast; the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection, and no boast; there will come to my Cistern more people than there can be between San‘a’ and Allah (Eilat).` Then it will be said: Call the Siddeeq's so that they might intercede. Then it will be said: Call the Prophets. So one Prophet will come with a group, and another Prophet will come with five or six people, and another Prophet will come with nobody. Then it will be said: Call the martyrs so that they might intercede for whoever they want. When the martyrs do that, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: I am the Most Merciful of those who show mercy; I admit to My Paradise anyone who does not associate anything with Me.

So they will enter Paradise. Then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look in Hell; can you find anyone who ever did anything good? And they will find a man in Hell, and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that I was easy-going with people in buying and selling. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Be easy-going with My slave as he was easygoing with My slaves. Then they will bring a man out of Hell and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that l instructed my sons: When I die, burn me with fire, then grind me until I am like kohl powder. Then take me to the sea and scatter me in the wind, for by Allah the Lord of the Worlds will never be able to punish me. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Why did you do that? He will say: For fear of You. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look at the kingdom of the greatest king and you will have the like thereof and ten times as much. He will say: Are You making fun of me when You are the Sovereign? He (the Prophet (ﷺ) said: “That is what I was smiling at, at the time of the foremoon.`";Musnad Ahmad 15, Book 1, Hadith 15;question #1;What is the significance of intercession on the Day of Resurrection in Islamic belief?

Ask Allah to keep you safe and sound, for no one is given anything, after certain faith (yaqeen) that is better than being kept safe and sound.` Then he said: “Do not sever ties with one another, do not turn your backs on one another, do not bear grudges against one another, do not envy one another, and be, O slaves of Allah, brothers.`;Musnad Ahmad 17, Book 1, Hadith 17;question #1;What are the consequences of adhering to truthfulness and righteousness in one's life?

If the ages of the camels for zakah differ, if what is due is a she-camel in its fifth year but he does not own such a camel, but he has a she-camel in its fourth year, then that will be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, if available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she-camel in its fourth year and he only has a she camel in its fifth year, it should be accepted from him and the zakat collector should give him back twenty dirhams or two sheep.

"I saw a dream that I can only interpret as meaning that my death is near; I saw as if a rooster pecked me twice, and I was told that it was a red rooster. I told this dream to Asma’ bint 'Umais, the wife of Abu Bakr , and she said: You will be killed by a Persian man.

If death comes to me soon, then the caliphate is to be decided by these six men with whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was pleased when he died. Whichever of them you swear allegiance to, then listen to him and obey. I know that some people will object to this matter. I have fought them with my own hands in the defence of Islam. 
They are the enemies of Allah and misguided kafirs. By Allah, I am not leaving behind anything that my Lord instructed me to do and I came to the position of caliphate on that basis that is more important to me than kalalah. By Allah, the Prophet of Allah ﷺ never emphasised any issue to me since I accompanied him more than the issue of kalalah, until he poked me in the chest with his finger and said: `Is not ayatas-saif (the verse of summer, i.e., it was revealed in summer), which appears at the end of Sooratan Nisa', sufficient for you?` If I live I will issue a decree that will be so clear that those who read the Qur'an and those who do not read it will be able to make decisions concerning it. I call upon Allah to bear witness over the governors of the regions, for I only sent them to be just and to teach the people their religion and the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ and to refer to me concerning any difficult matter.

By Allah, the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) argue with him, and one of them will forsake him all day until night comes, I went and entered upon Hafsah, and I said: Do
you argue with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? She said: Yes. I said: Does one of you forsake him all day until night comes? She said: Yes. I said: Any one of you who does that is doomed and lost. Does any one of you feel assured that Allah will not be angry with her because of the anger of His
Messenger (ﷺ), for then she will be doomed? Do not argue with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and do not ask him for anything. Ask me for whatever you want. And do not be misled by the fact that your neighbour is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) than
you – referring to 'A'ishah. And ‘Umar said: I had a neighbour among the Ansar. We used to take turns to go down to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He would go down one day and I would go down the next. He would bring me the news of the Revelation and other things, and I would do likewise.

He said: Do not do that, for I used to do what you are doing, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would give me payment, and I would say: Give it someone who is more in need of it than me, And he said: Whatever of this wealth comes to you when you are not hoping for it or asking for it, take it, otherwise do not hanker after it.”It was narrated that as-Sa`ib bin Yazeed said: `Umar met `Abdullah bin as-Sa`di... and he mentioned a similar report, but he said: “Give it in charity,” and he said: “Do not hanker after it.`";Musnad Ahmad 279, 280, Book 2, Hadith 190;question #1;What is the significance of accepting payment for work done for the state in Islam?

"I heard ‘Umar say: Do not make women`s dowries expensive, do not make women`s dowries expensive, for had this been a sign of honour in this world or piety before Allah, the first one of you to do it would have been the Prophet (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not give any of his wives, and none of his daughters were given, any more than twelve Oasiyyahs [as a dowry. And a man will go to great trouble in order to offer a high dowry to his wife.
On one occasion he said: A man would pay his wife a high dowry until he feels resentment towards her and says: You cost me everything I own, even the string to tie a waterskin and hang it up. He [the narrator] said: I was a young Arab boy with a non-Arab mother, and I did not know what a `string` was. `Umar said: And another thing you say of one who is killed in your campaigns and dies that so and so was killed as a martyr, and o and so died as a martyr. But perhaps he loaded the back of his mount with gold and silver for the purpose of trading. So do not say that, rather say what the Prophet (ﷺ) (or what Muhammad) (ﷺ) said: “Whoever is killed or dies for the sake of Allah will be in Paradise.`";Musnad Ahmad 285, Book 2, Hadith 195;question #1;What is the significance of keeping dowries reasonable in Islamic teachings?
"`Umar bin al-Khattab gave a speech and said: O people, we used to know you when the Prophet (ﷺ) was among us and revelation was coming down to him; Allah would tell us about you. But now the Prophet (ﷺ) has passed away and revelation has ceased, and now the way to judge you is this whoever among you shows us good conduct, we will think well of him and love him; whoever among you shows us bad conduct, we will think badly of him and hate him for that, and whatever is in your hearts is between you and your Lord. There was a time when I used to think that whoever learned the Qur`an, seeking thereby Allah and (the reward that) is with Him, would be rewarded in the Hereafter, but some men learned Qur`an seeking that which is with people. So seek Allah by learning Qur`an and by your good deeds. By Allah, I do not send my workers to strike you or seize your wealth; rather I send them to you to teach you your religion and Sunnah, whoever has done to him something other than that, let him refer it to me, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, I shall surely grant him retaliation. `Amr bin al-`As stood up and said: O Ameer al Mu`mineen, do you think if one of the Muslims was in charge of some people and he disciplined one of them, would you allow that one to settle the score with him? He said: Yes, by the One in Whose hand is the soul of `Umar, I would not certainly allow him to settle the score with him. I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) do that with regard to himself. But do not strike the Muslims and thus humiliate them, and do not keep them away from their wives on campaign for too long and thus expose them to temptation. Do not withhold from them their due rights and cause them to rebel; and do not make them camp in an area with a lot of trees, because that will cause them to be scattered.It was narrated that ‘Abul-`Ajfa` as-Sulami said: I heard ‘Umar say: Do not make women`s dowries expensive,... and he mentioned the same hadeeth.";Musnad Ahmad 286, 287, Book 2, Hadith 196;question #1;How did the cessation of revelation after the Prophet's passing affect the way people were judged in the community?

He came and sat beside me, so I was between them, and we heard a voice from inside the house, Ibn `Umar said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: `The deceased is tormented because of the crying of his family.` He said: And `Abdullah understood it as general in meaning. Ibn `Abbas said: We were with Ameer al-Muʼmineen ‘Umar until we came to some arid land, where we found a man who had halted in the shade of a tree. He said to me: Go and find out for me who that man is, I went and found that it was Suhaib. I came back to him and said: You told me to find out for you who that man is; it is Suhaib. He said: Tell him to join us. I said: He has his family with him. He said: Even if he has his family with him [and perhaps Ayyoob said on one occasion:Tell him to join us).

I went to `A`ishah, and I told her what Ibn `Umar had said. She said: No, by Allah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not say, “The deceased is tormented because of the weeping of anyone.” Rather he said: “Allah increases the torment of the kafir because of his family`s weeping, and that it is He (Allah) Who makes (whom He wills) laugh, and makes (whom He wills) weep, “And no bearer of burdens shall bear another`s burden` [Al Anʼam 6:164].” Ayyoob said: Ibn Abu Mulaikah said: al-Qasim bin Muhammad told me: When `Aʼishah heard what ʼUmar and Ibn `Umar had said, she said. You are narrating to me from two who are not liars and are not to be suspected of being liars, but one may mishear.`Abdullah bin Abi Mulaikah narrated… and he mentioned a hadeeth similar to that of Ayyoob, except that he said: ibn `Umar said to `Amr bin `Uthman, when he was facing him: Why don`t you tell them not to weep?

Thus it is to be given on the basis of a man`s efforts for the sake of lslam, his seniority in Islam, his support for Islam, and his need.

It was said to Sa`d: A man has done such and such. He said: That is Muhammad bin Maslamah. He went out to him and swore by Allah that he never said that. He said: We will convey from you what you have said and we will do as we were instructed. So he burned the door. Then he [Sa`d] offered some supplies (to the envoy) but he refused. He left at midday and went to ‘Umar(رضي الله عنه), and he went and came back within nineteen days. He said: Were it not that I think well of you, I would have thought that you did not convey my message. He said: Yes I did convey it, he conveys his salam and apologises, and he swore by Allah that he did not say that. He said: Did he give you any provisions? He said: No. He said: What prevented you from supplying (sufficient, provisions to me yourself? He said: I did not want to instruct that you be given the cold whilst I had the hot [i.e., I could not have given you what you wanted of food and enjoyed plentiful food myself, when around me are the people of Madinah who are starving, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  say: `No man should eat his fill when his neighbour is going without.”;Musnad Ahmad 390, Book 2, Hadith 291;question #1;What actions did ‘Umar take when he heard about the construction of Sa`d's palace?
"I used to recite to ‘AbdurRahman bin ‘Awf, and he found me waiting for him. That was in Mina during the last Hajj performed by `Umar bin al-Khattab (رضي الله عنه) Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf said: A man came to `Umar bin al-Khattab and said: So and so is saying: If `Umar (رضي الله عنه) dies, I will swear allegiance to So and so. ʼUmar (رضي الله عنه) said: I will stand before the people today and warn them against these people who want to deprive them of their rights, `Abdur-Rahman said: I said: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, do not do that, for the Hajj season brings together the riffraff and rabble among the people, and most of the people who gather around and listen to you will be of that type. Is you stand before the people, I am afraid that you will say something that they will spread and not understand it properly or interpret it properly. Rather wait until you come to Madinah, for it is the land of Hijrah and the Sunnah, and you will meet the most knowledgeable and noble people there, and you can say what you want to say with confidence; they wilt understand what you say and will interpret it correctly, `Umar (رضي الله عنه) said: If I reach Madinah safe and sound, I shall certainly talk to the people there in the first speech I deliver. When we came to Madinah at the end of Dhul-I-Iijah, it was a Friday. I set out early, ‘Umar did not care at what time he went out, because he did not pay attention to heat and cold and so on. I found Sa`eed bin Zaid at the right-hand corner of the minbar, he had got there before me. I sat down next to him, with my knee touching his knee, and it was not long before `Umar (رضي الله عنه)came. When I saw him, I said: He will certainly speak today on this minbar and say something that no one ever heard before. Sa`eed bin Zaid objected to that and said: What do you think he will say that no one said before? `Umar (رضي الله عنه)sat on the minbar, and when the mu`dhdhin fell silent, he stood up and praised and glorified Allah as He deserves, then he said: To proceed o people, I am going to tell you something that it has been decreed I should say. I do not know, perhaps it may signal my death. So whoever understands it and remembers it, let him narrate it to others wherever his mount takes him; whoever does not understand il, it is not permissible for him to tell lies about me. Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, sent Muhammad (ﷺ) with the truth and revealed the Book to him; among the things that were revealed to him was the verse of stoning [adulterers). We read it and understood it; the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stoned [adulterers] and we stoned adulterers] after him. But I fear that with the passage of time, some people will say: We do not find the verse of stoning in the Book of Allah, thus they will go astray by forsaking an  obligation that Allah revealed. Stoning is the due punishment in the Book of Allah for those who commit zina, both men and women, if they have been married and if proof is established, or there is a pregnancy or a confession, And we used to recite: Do not claim to be the offspring of anyone other than your fathers, as it is disbelief (or ingratitude) on your part to claim to be the offspring of anyone other than your fathers, Verily the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Do not praise me excessively as `Eesa, the son of Maryam, was praised; rather I am the slave of Allah, so say, the slave of Allah and His Messenger.` I have heard that some among you are saying. If `Umar (رضي الله عنه) dies, I shall swear allegiance to So and so. No man should deceive himself by saying that the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was is successful. There is no doubt that this is the case, but Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, saved the to 2 people from its bad consequences and there is no one among you today who has the qualities of Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) What happened to us when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died was that ‘Ali, az-Zubair and those who were with them stayed behind in the house of Fatimah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and all the Ansar stayed behind and gathered in Saqeefat Banu Sa`idah, whilst the Muhajireen gathered around Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) I said to him; O Abu Bakr, let us go to our brothers, the Ansar. So we set out, looking for them, then we were met by two righteous men who told us what the people had done, and said: where are you going, O Muhajireen? I said: We are looking for these brothers of ours, the Ansar, They said. You should not go near them; do whatever you have already decided, O Muhajireen. I said: By Allah, we will go to them. So we carried on until we came to them in Saqeefat Banu Sa`idah, where we found them gathered and among them was a man wrapped up [in a garment. I said: Who is this? They said: Sa`d bin `Ubadah. ! said: What is the matter with him? They said: He is sick. After we sat down, their spokesman stood up and praised and glorified Allah, may He glorified and exalted, as He deserves, then he said: To proceed. We are the supporters (Ansar) of Allah and the majority of the Muslim army. You, O Muhajireen, are a small group among us. Some of you came to us, wanting to deny who we are and prevent us from attaining a position of authority. When he fell silent, I wanted to present a speech that I had prepared and that I liked in front of Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) I used to avoid provoking him and he was more forbearing and more dignified than me. But Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) said: Wait a while. I did not like to make him angry, and he was more knowledgeable and more dignified than me. By Allah, he did not omit any word that I liked in the speech I had prepared but he said something like it or better, speaking spontaneously, until he finished speaking. Then he said: To proceed. Whatever you have mentioned about your achievements and virtues, is correct. The Arabs would not acknowledge the leadership of anyone except someone from this tribe of Quraish, for they are the best of the Arabs in lineage and location. I am pleased to suggest to you one of these two men, whichever of them you want. Then he took hold of my hand and the hand of Abu `Ubaidah bin al-Jarrah, and I disliked nothing of what he had said apart from this, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck struck for no sin on my part than to become the leader of people among whom was Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) unless my own self suggested something at the time of death. One of the Ansar said: I am the post on which the camel with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree [i.e., a noble]. [I suggest] a ruler from among us and a ruler from among you, O Quraish. - I the narrator said to Malik; What does ‘I am the post on which the cainc! with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree` mean? He said:It is as if he is saying, I am the smart one who has the answer. - Then there was a great deal of clamour and raised voices, to such an extent that I feared there would be a conflict, so I said: Hold out your hand, O Abu Bakr. So he held out his hand and I swore allegiance to him, and the Muhajireen swore allegiance to him, then the Ansar swore allegiance to him. Thus we surrounded Sa`d bin ‘Ubadah. One of them said: You have killed Sa`d i said: May Allah kill Sa’d! And `Umar (رضي الله عنه) said: By Allah, we never encountered any problem greater than the swearing of allegiance to Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) . We were afraid that if we left the people without having sworn allegiance to anyone, they might swear allegiance after we were gone, so we would either follow in their footsteps and swear allegiance to someone we were not pleased with, or we would disagree with them and that would cause trouble. If anyone swears allegiance to a leader without consulting the Muslims, there is no allegiance for him and no allegiance to the one who swore allegiance to him, lest both of them be killed. Malik said: Ibn Shihab told me, from `Urwah bin az-Zubair, that the men whom they met were `Uwaim bin Sa`idah and Ma`n bin `Adiyy. Ibn Shihab said. Sa`eed bin al-Musayyab told me that the one who said, I am the post on which the camel with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree, was al-lubab bin al-Mundhir.";Musnad Ahmad 391, Book 3, Hadith 1;question #1;What concerns did 'Umar ibn al-Khattab have about the potential misinterpretation of his words during the Hajj season?

What made you do that? `Uthman (رضي الله عنه)said: Sometimes many soorahs would be revealed (incomplete) to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) , and when something was revealed he would call one of the scribes to write it down for him and say: “Put this in the Soorah in which such and such is mentioned`; and verses would be revealed to him and he would say, `Put these verses in the soorah in which such and such is mentioned”; and a verse would be revealed to him and he would say: `Put this verse in the soorah in which such and such is mentioned.” Al-Anfal was one of the first soorahs to be revealed in Madinah and Bara`ah was one of the last soorahs of the Qur`an, and the stories and content of the two soorahs were similar. 
Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  passed away without having stated clearly to us that it was part of it, but we thought that it was, hence I put them together and I did not put between them the line Bismillahir-Rahmanir-Raheem.

"`Abdullah bin Shaddad came and entered upon `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) when we were sitting with her, as he was returning from Iraq during the time when ‘Ali           (رضي الله عنه) was murdered. She said to him: O `Abdullah bin Shaddad, will you tell me the truth about what I am going to ask you? Tell me about these people whom ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) killed. He said: Why shouldn`t I tell you the truth? She said: Tell me about them. He said: When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) corresponded with Mu`awiyah and the two arbitrators gave their verdict, eight thousand of the pious rebelled against him and camped in a land called Haroora`, near Koofah. They criticised him and said: You have taken off a chemise that Allah caused you to wear and a title that Allah gave to you, then you went ahead and asked people to issue a decree concerning the religion of Allah. There is no ruling except the ruling of Allah, may He be exalted. When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) heard about their criticism of him and the reason why they had split from him, he told his caller not to admit anyone but those who had memorised the Qur`an. When the house was filled with people who had memorised the Qur`an, he called for a large Mushaf and put it front of him, and he started tapping it with his hand, saying: O Mushaf, tell the people. The people called out: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, how could you ask it? It is only ink and paper, but we could speak on the basis of what we understand from it. What do you want? He said: These companions of yours who rebelled, between me and them is the Book of Allah, and Allah says in His Book concerning a woman and a man: `If you fear a breach between them twain (the man and his wife), appoint (two) arbitrators, one from his family and the other from hers; if they both wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation.` [an-Nisa 4:35]. The ummah of Muhammad is more important with regard to life and sanctity than a woman and a man. They got angry with me when I wrote a document between me and Mu`awiyah and wrote `Ali bin Abi Talib [without adding the title Ameer al-Mu`mineen]. But Suhail bin `Amr came to us when we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at al-Hudaibiyah, when he made a peace deal with Quraish, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote, `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.` Suhail said: Do not write, In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He said: What should we write? He said: Write: `In Your Name, O Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Write `Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).` He [Suhail] said: If I knew that you were the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I would not have opposed you. So he wrote: This is what was agreed by Muhammad bin `Abdullah with Quraish. And Allah says in His Book: “Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day` [Al-Ahzab 33:21]. So `Ali sent `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه) to them and I went out with him until we reached the middle of their camp. Ibnul-Kawwa` stood up and addressed the people, saying: O bearers of the Qur`an, this is `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه). Whoever does not know him, I know of the Book of Allah what can tell you about him, He is one of those concerning whom the words `they are a quarrelsome people` [Az-Zukhruf 43:58] were revealed. Tell him to go back to the one who sent him and do not discuss the Book of Allah with him. Their spokesmen stood up and said: By Allah, we will discuss the Book of Allah. If he says something sound and true that we recognise we will follow him, and if he says something false we will reject his false argument. So they discussed the Book with ‘Abdullah for three days, and four thousand of them recanted and all of them repented, including Ibnul-Kawwa`. He took them to `Ali in Koofah, and `Ali sent word to the rest of them, saying: You know the turmoil between us and our opponents. Stay wherever you wish until the ummah of Muhammad (ﷺ) is united. The deal between us and you is that you should not shed any blood that it is forbidden to shed or commit acts of banditry on the roads or do wrong to any Non Muslim under Muslim protection. If you do that, we will declare war, for Allah does not love those who betray. `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) said: O Ibn Shaddad, did he kill them? He said: By Allah, no sooner had he sent this message to them but they committed acts of banditry, shed blood and regarded it as permissible to harm Ahludh-Dhimmah (non-Muslims living under Muslim protection). She said: Do you swear by Allah? He said: I swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other god that this is what happened. She said: I have heard that the people of Iraq are talking and saying dhuth-thuda, dhuth-thuda [i.e., the one with a deformed arm that looks like a breast]. He said: I saw him and I was with ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) when he was examining the slain. He called the people and said: Do you know this one? How many of them came and said: I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so, and I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so. And there was no proof of who he was except that. She said: What did `Ali say when he stood over him, as the people of Iraq claim? He said: I heard him say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. She said: Did you hear him say anything other than that? He said: No, by Allah. She said: Yes, Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. May Allah have mercy on `Ali (رضي الله عنه): it was his habit, if he saw something he liked, to say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. But the people of Iraq fabricated lies against him and added words to what he said.";Musnad Ahmad 656, Book 5, Hadith 92;question #1;What was the reason for the rebellion against Ali (رضي الله عنه) by a group of people?

"When we came to Madinah we ate from its fruits and did not feel comfortable in it, and we became ill. The Prophet (ﷺ) was trying to find out about the well of Badr, and when we heard that the mushrikeen had come, the Messenger of Allah  (ﷺ) marched to Badr, and Badr was a well. We got there before the mushrikeen and we found two of their men, a man from Quraish and a freed slave of “Uqbah bin Abi Mu`ait. As for the Qurashi, he managed to escape, but we caught the freed slave of ‘Uqbah and started asking him: How many are the people? He said: By Allah, they are great in number and powerful. When he said that, the Muslims began to beat him and they brought him to the Prophet (ﷺ), who said: How many are the people? He said: By Allah, they are great in number and powerful. The Prophet (ﷺ) tried hard to make him tell him how many they were, but he refused. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) asked him: How many camels do they slaughter? He said: Ten each day. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: They are one thousand; each camel is for one hundred men. Then a shower of rain fell on us at night and we rushed to seek shelter beneath the trees and leather shields, sheltering from the rain. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) spent the night calling upon his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, saying: “O Allah, if You cause this band to be destroyed, You will never be worshipped.” When dawn came, he called out: `Prayer, O slaves of Allah!” And the people came from beneath the trees and shields and the Messenger of Allah led us in prayer and encouraged us to fight. Then he said: `The army of Quraish is beneath this red outcrop of the mountain.` When the people drew close to us, and we stood in ranks facing one another, we saw one of their men, riding a red camel of his, going around among the people. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `O `Ali, call Hamzah for me` - as he was the closest of them to the mushrikeen - and said `Who is the one on the red camel and what is he saying to them?` Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: `If there is anyone among the people who is enjoining good, then perhaps it is the one on the red camel.` Hamzah came and said: He is `Utbah bin Rabee`ah, and he is telling them not to fight; he is saying to them: O people, I can see people who are going to fight to the death and you will never be able to harm them, because it will cost you too dear to do so. O people, put the blame on me and say: `Utbah bin Rabee`ah is a coward, although you know that I am not the most cowardly among you. Abu Jahl heard that and said: Are you saying this? By Allah, if anyone else said this I would have insulted him; you are filled with fear, ‘Utbah said: Do you mean me, O you with the whistling rear end (i.e., one who breaks wind a great deal because of fear)? Today you will know which of us is the coward. Then ‘Utbah and his brother Shaibah and his son al-Waleed stepped forward in a display of courage and said: Who will come out to fight in single combat? Six young men of the Ansar stepped forward, but `Utbah said: We do not want these; let some of our cousins of Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib come out. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Get up, O Ali, get up, O Hamzah, get up, O `Ubaidah bin al-Harith bin ‘Abdul-Muttalib.` Allah caused `Utbah and Shaibah, the two sons of Rabee`ah, and al-Waleed bin ‘Utbah to be killed and ‘Ubaidah was wounded. We killed seventy of them and captured seventy. A short Ansari man brought al-Abbas bin `Abdul-Muttalib as a captive, and al-`Abbas said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), by Allah, this is not the one who captured me; I was captured by a bold man who was one of the most handsome of people, who was riding a piebald horse, but I do not see him among the people. The Ansari said: I captured him, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: `Be quiet! Allah, may He be exalted, supported you with a noble angel.` `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: We took prisoners, and from among Banu `Abdul-Muttalib, we captured al-`Abbas, ‘Aqeel and Nawfal bin al-Harith.";Musnad Ahmad 948, Book 5, Hadith 375;question #1;What strategies did the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) use to gather intelligence about the enemy forces before the Battle of Badr?

"Abu Bakr bought a saddle from ‘Azib for thirteen dirhams, then Abu Bakr said to 'Azib. Tell al-Bara to carry it to my house. He said: No, not until you tell us what happened when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out and you were with him. Abu Bakr said: We started our journey at the beginning of the night and we hastened for one day and one night, until it was midday. I looked into the distance to see whether there was anywhere to seek shade, and I saw a rock, so I went to it and it had a little shade. I smoothed the ground for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and spread a garment of camel hair for him, and said: Lie down and rest, O Messenger of Allah. So he lay down, and I went out to see if I could spot anyone looking for us. Then I saw a shepherd and I said: Who do you belong to, O boy? He said: To a man of Quraish. He mentioned his name and I recognised it. I said: Is there any milk in your sheep? He said: Yes | said: Will you milk some for me? He said: Yes. I told him to do that, so he caught a sheep, then I told him to brush the dust from its teat, then to brush the dust off his hands. I had a small vessel with me on the neck of which was a cloth. He milked a little bit of milk for me and I poured it into the vessel until it cooled down. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When I reached him, he had already woken up. I said: Drink, O Messenger of Allah. He drank until I was pleased, then I said: Is it time to move on? So we moved on and the people were coming after us but none of them caught up with us except Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju'shum, who was riding a horse of his, I said: O Messenger of Allah, someone has caught up with us. He said: `Do not be afraid, for Allah is with us.` When he got close to us, and there was no more between us and him then the length of a spear or two or three spears, I said: O Messenger of Allah, this pursuer has caught up with us, and I wept. He said: `Why are you weeping?` I said: I am not weeping for myself; rather I am weeping for you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed against him [the pursuer] and said: “O Allah, protect us from him by whatever means You will.” Then his horse's legs sank into the solid ground up to its belly, and he fell off it. He said: O Muhammad, I know that this is because of you; pray to Allah to save me from my predicament, and by Allah I shall divert away from you any one who is behind me of those who are seeking you. Here is my quiver, take one arrow. You are going to pass by some camels and sheep of mine in such and such a place, take whatever you need from thern. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `I have no need of it.“ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed for him and he was released, and he went back to his companions. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and I continued on our way until we came to Madinah, where the people met him. They came out on the road and on the roofs, and a lot of servants and children crowded the road saying: Allahu Akbar, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has come, Muhammad has come. The people disputed as to who he would stay with. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Tonight I will stay with Banun-Najjar, the maternal uncles of 'Abdul-Muttalib, to honour them thereby.” The next morning, he went where he was instructed. Al-Bara' bin 'Azib said: The first of the Muhajireen to come to us was Mus'ab bin 'Umair, the brother of Banu 'Abdud-Dar. Then Ibn Umm Maktoom, the blind man and brother of Banu Fihr, came to us. Then 'Umar bin al-Khattab, came to us with twenty riders and we said: What happened to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? He said: He is behind me. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came and Abu Bakr was with him. Al-Bara said: the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not come until I had read some soorahs from al-Mufassal [Al-Mufassal is that portion of the Qur'an which goes from Qaf to an-Nas].

He went around doing that for three days, then [the Prophet (ﷺ) said to ‘Ali; “Go and catch up with him; send Abu Bakr back to me and you convey it.” So he did that. And when Abu Bakr carme to the Prophet (ﷺ) , he wept and said: O Messenger of Allah, is there something the matter with me?

"One day the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got up and prayed Fajr, then he sat until the forenoon, then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled. Then he sat where he was until he had prayed Zuhr, 'Asr and Maghrib, and he did not speak until he had prayed 'isha'. Then he got up and went to his family. The people said to Abu Bakr: Why don't you ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) what is the matter? He did something today that he never did before. So he asked him and he said: `Yes, I was shown what is to come of this world and the Hereafter. The earlier and later generations were gathered in one place and the people got terrified because of that. They went to Adam when the sweat was about to reach their mouths, and they said: O Adam, you are the father of mankind and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose you. Intercede for us with your Lord, He said: I am in the same position as you. Go to your father after your father, to Nooh, “Allah chose Adam, Nooh (Noah), the family of Ibraheem (Abraham) and the family of 'Imran above the 'Alameen (mankind and jinn) (of their times)` (Al 'Imran 3:33}.

Then they will go to Nooh and will say: Intercede with your Lord for us, for Allah chose you and answered your supplication, and He did not leave one of the disbelievers on the Earth (cf. 71:26). He will say: I am not the one you want; go to Ibraheem for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, took him as a close friend (khaleel). So they will go to Ibraheem but he will say: I am not the one you want; go to Moosa, for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, spoke directly to him (cf. 4:164). But Moosa will say: I am not the one you want; go to 'Eesa Ibn Maryam, for he healed those born blind and the lepers, and he brought forth the dead. But 'Eesa will say: I am not the one you want; go to the leader of the sons of Adam, for he is the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection. Go to Muhammad, for he will intercede for you with your Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. Then (the Prophet) will go and Jibreel will come to his Lord and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Give him permission and give him the glad tidings of Paradise. Jibreel will take him and he will fall down in prostration for a week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intercession will be accepted. So he will raise his head, and when he looks at his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, he will fall down in prostration for another week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intersession will be accepted. He will start to fall down in prostration again, but Jibreel (peace be upon him) will take hold of his upper arms and Allah, may he be glorified and exalted, will inspire him to offer a supplication such as no human being was ever inspired with. He will say: `O Lord, You created me as the leader of the sons of Adam, and no boast; the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection, and no boast; there will come to my Cistern more people than there can be between San‘a’ and Allah (Eilat).` Then it will be said: Call the Siddeeq's so that they might intercede. Then it will be said: Call the Prophets. So one Prophet will come with a group, and another Prophet will come with five or six people, and another Prophet will come with nobody. Then it will be said: Call the martyrs so that they might intercede for whoever they want. When the martyrs do that, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: I am the Most Merciful of those who show mercy; I admit to My Paradise anyone who does not associate anything with Me.

So they will enter Paradise. Then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look in Hell; can you find anyone who ever did anything good? And they will find a man in Hell, and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that I was easy-going with people in buying and selling. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Be easy-going with My slave as he was easygoing with My slaves. Then they will bring a man out of Hell and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that l instructed my sons: When I die, burn me with fire, then grind me until I am like kohl powder. Then take me to the sea and scatter me in the wind, for by Allah the Lord of the Worlds will never be able to punish me. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Why did you do that? He will say: For fear of You. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look at the kingdom of the greatest king and you will have the like thereof and ten times as much. He will say: Are You making fun of me when You are the Sovereign? He (the Prophet (ﷺ) said: “That is what I was smiling at, at the time of the foremoon.`";Musnad Ahmad 15, Book 1, Hadith 15;question #2;How does the concept of intercession highlight the roles of different prophets in Islam?

Ask Allah to keep you safe and sound, for no one is given anything, after certain faith (yaqeen) that is better than being kept safe and sound.` Then he said: “Do not sever ties with one another, do not turn your backs on one another, do not bear grudges against one another, do not envy one another, and be, O slaves of Allah, brothers.`;Musnad Ahmad 17, Book 1, Hadith 17;question #2;How does lying and immorality affect a person's spiritual journey?

Then Abu Bakr and ‘Umar came together to the people, Abu Bakr spoke and did not omit anything that was revealed concerning the Ansar or that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said concerning them but he mentioned it. And he said: You know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `If the people were to walk in one direction and the Ansar were to walk in another, I would walk in the direction of the Ansar.` I know, O Sa'd, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, when you were sitting here: `Quraish are to be in charge of this affair (Islam), so the righteous people are but followers of the righteous of (Quraish), and the wrongdoers among the people are but followers of the wrongdoers of (Quraish).` Sa'd said to hümn: You have spoken the truth: we are advisers and you are leaders.";Musnad Ahmad 18, Book 1, Hadith 18;question #2;How did Abu Bakr demonstrate his respect and love for the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) after his death?

'Uthman said: I was one of them. Whilst I was sitting in the shade of a small fort, ‘Umar passed by me and greeted me, and I did not realise that he had passed me or greeted me, ‘Umar went to Abu Bakr and said to him: Do you think it is right that I passed by ‘Uthman and greeted him and he did not return my greeting?

Then Abu Bakr said: Your brother ‘Umar came to me and told me that he passed by you and greeted you but you did not return his greeting; what made you do that? I said: I did not do that. 'Umar said: Yes, by Allah, you did that, but you have too much pride, O Banu Umayyah. I said: By Allah, I did not realise that you had passed me or greeted me.

"These are the types of charity (zakah) that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made obligatory upon the Muslims and which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, enjoined upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Whoever among the Muslims is asked to pay it in the proper manner, let him give it; whoever is asked for more than that, let him not give it.

If the number reaches forty-six, then a she-camel in its fourth year that has been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to sixty, If the number reaches sixty-one, then a she-camel in its fifth year (should be given), up to seventy five. If the number reaches seventy-six, then two she-camels in their second year (should be given), up to ninety. If the number reaches ninety-one, then two she camels in their fourth year that have been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to one hundred and twenty. If the number is more than one hundred and twenty, then for every forty camels, a she-camel limits third year should be given and for every fifty a she-camel in its fourth year. If the ages of the camels for zakah differ, if what is due is a she-camel in its fifth year but he does not own such a camel, but he has a she-camel in its fourth year, then that will be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, if available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she-camel in its fourth year and he only has a she camel in its fifth year, it should be accepted from him and the zakat collector should give him back twenty dirhams or two sheep. If what is due from him is a shecamel in its fourth year, but he does not have such a cameland he has a she-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, is available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she camel in its second year, but he only has a he-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and nothing should be added to it. If he has only four camels, no zakah is due unless the owner wants to give it. With regard to zakah on sheep in the pasture, if there are forty sheep, then one sheep is due as zakah, up to one hundred and twenty sheep. of there is one more than that, then two sheep are due, up to two hundred.

Separate flocks should not be put together and flocks should not be divided so as to avoid or reduce zakah. If there are two partners [and the zakah-collector comes and takes zakah), they should settle the matter between them on a fair basis. If a man's flock is grazing if it is one less than forty, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it.

So he set out and when he was in al-Hawa'it, he entered ihram for both Haji and 'Umrah together, Zaid bin Soohan and Salman bin Rabee'ah saw him and said: He is more astray than his camel, or he is no more guided than his camel.

"I saw a dream that I can only interpret as meaning that my death is near; I saw as if a rooster pecked me twice, and I was told that it was a red rooster. I told this dream to Asma’ bint 'Umais, the wife of Abu Bakr , and she said: You will be killed by a Persian man. The people are asking me to appoint a successor, but Allah will not cause His religion and His caliphate, with which He sent His Prophet ﷺ to be lost. If death comes to me soon, then the caliphate is to be decided by these six men with whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was pleased when he died. Whichever of them you swear allegiance to, then listen to him and obey. I know that some people will object to this matter. I have fought them with my own hands in the defence of Islam. 
They are the enemies of Allah and misguided kafirs. By Allah, I am not leaving behind anything that my Lord instructed me to do and I came to the position of caliphate on that basis that is more important to me than kalalah. By Allah, the Prophet of Allah ﷺ never emphasised any issue to me since I accompanied him more than the issue of kalalah, until he poked me in the chest with his finger and said: `Is not ayatas-saif (the verse of summer, i.e., it was revealed in summer), which appears at the end of Sooratan Nisa', sufficient for you?` If I live I will issue a decree that will be so clear that those who read the Qur'an and those who do not read it will be able to make decisions concerning it. I call upon Allah to bear witness over the governors of the regions, for I only sent them to be just and to teach the people their religion and the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ and to refer to me concerning any difficult matter. O people, you eat two plants which I find to be nothing but repugnant, this onion and garlic. I remember the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, if he noticed their smell coming from a man in the mosque, he would issue orders that he taken out from the mosque to al-Baqee'.

They have attacked 'Abdullah bin ‘Umar and dislocated his arms, as you heard about their attack on the Ansari before him. We do not doubt that they are the ones who did it, as we have no other enemy but them. Whoever has property in Khaibar, let him go there, for I am going to expel the Jews.

It was said: `Whether you (O Muhammad) ask forgiveness for them (hypocrites) or ask not forgiveness for them- (and even) if you ask seventy times for their forgiveness-Allah will not forgive them' [at-Tawbah 9:80].

Certainly they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and died while they were Fasiqoon (rebellious, - disobedient to AIlah and His Messenger).`[at-Tawbah9:84].

The Prophet ﷺ would give me some payment and I would say: Give it to one who is more in need of it than me. One day he gave me something and I said: Give it to one who is more in need of it than me.

It is not the word of a poet, little is that you believe!” [al-Haqqah 69:40-41]. I said: (He is a) soothsayer. He said: “Nor is it the word of a soothsayer (or a foreteller), little is that you remember! This is the Revelation sent down from the Lord of the 'Alameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists). And if he (Muhammad ﷺ) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah). We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), And then We certainly would have cut off his life artery (aorta), And none of you could have withheld Us from (punishing) him...” [al-Haqqah 69:42—47]. lle said: Then I felt an overwhelming attraction to Islam.;Musnad Ahmad 107, Book 2, Hadith 25;question #2;How does the Qur'an address the accusations of the Prophet Muhammad being a poet or soothsayer?

Then he said: If my time comes, and Abu 'Ubaidah has died, then I appoint Mu'adh bin Jabal as my successor, and if my Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, asks me why I appointed him as my successor, I will say: I heard Your Messenger say:`He will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection as a leader of scholars.`;Musnad Ahmad 108, Book 2, Hadith 26;question #2;Who was considered the close confidant of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ according to this narration?

"I dreamt that a rooster pecked me twice, and I can only interpret it as meaning that my death is near, and there are 
people who are telling me I should appoint someone to be my successor, but Allah will not cause His religion and the caliphate, with which He sent His Prophet ﷺ, to be lost. If death comes to me soon, then the caliphate is to be decided by these six men with whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was pleased when he died. Whichever of them you swear allegiance to, then listen to him and obey. I know that some people will object to this matter. I have fought them with my own hands in the defence of Islam. If they do that, then they are the enemies of Allah and misguided kafirs. I am not leaving behind anything more important to me than kalalah. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ never emphasised any issue to me since I accompanied him more than the issue of kalalah, and I did not ask him about anything more than I asked him about kalalah, until he poked me in the chest with his finger and said: “O 'Umar, is not ayatus­-saif (the verse of summer, i.e. it was revealed in summer), which appears at the end of Soorat an-Nisa', sufficient for you?` If I live I will issue a decree that will be so clear that those who read the Qur'an and those who do not read it will be able to make decisions concerning it. Then he said. O Allah, I call upon You to bear witness over the governors of the regions, for I only sent them to teach the people their religion and the Sunnah of their Prophet and to the divide the fai' among them and to be just to them and to refer to me concerning any difficult matter, O people, you eat two plants which I find to be nothing but repugnant. I remember the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, if he noticed their smell coming from a man in the mosque, he would issue orders 
that he taken by the hand and led out to al­-Baqee', Whoever must eat them, let him cook them to death.`";Musnad Ahmad 186, Book 2, Hadith 103;question #2;How was the process of selecting a caliph after the Prophet Muhammad's death approached according to Umar bin al Khattab?
I heard 'Umar bin al-Khattab say to Talhah bin‘Ubaidullah: Why do I see you looking unkempt and dusty since the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died? Perhaps you were upset about your cousin becoming caliph? He said: Allah forbid! I am the most unlikely among you to feel like that, I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: `I know a word which, if a man says it when dying his soul will find rest and provision when it comes out from his body and it will be light for him on the Day of Resurrection.” I did not ask the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about it and he did not tell me it. This is what has been upsetting me. 'Umar said: I know what it is. He said: To Allah be praise! What is it? He said: It is the word that he said to his uncle: La ilaha illallah. Talhah said: You are right.;Musnad Ahmad 187, Book 2, Hadith 104;question #2;How did the companions of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) react to the leadership changes after his death?

O Allah, accomplish for me what You have promised me!

to me so that I may strike his neck. You should hand ‘Aqeel over to ‘Ali so that he may strike his neck, and you should hand over So and so to Hamzah (his brother) so that he may strike his neck, so that Allah will know that we have no mercy in our hearts towards the mushrikeen; these are 
their prominent figures and leaders. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  inclined towards the view of Abu Bakr, and he did not incline towards what I said, and accepted ransoms from them.

I have been shown your punishment as close as this tree` ­ a tree that was close to the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) Then Allah revealed the words:`It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land.

My house was among Banu Umayyah bin Zaid in al-'Awali. One day I got angry with my wife, and she argued with me. I did not like her to argue with me, but she said: Do you not like me to argue with you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) argue with him, and one of them will forsake him all day until night comes, I went and entered upon Hafsah, and I said: Do
you argue with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? She said: Yes. I said: Does one of you forsake him all day until night comes? She said: Yes. I said: Any one of you who does that is doomed and lost. Does any one of you feel assured that Allah will not be angry with her because of the anger of His
Messenger (ﷺ), for then she will be doomed? Do not argue with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and do not ask him for anything. Ask me for whatever you want. And do not be misled by the fact that your neighbour is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) than
you – referring to 'A'ishah. And ‘Umar said: I had a neighbour among the Ansar. We used to take turns to go down to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He would go down one day and I would go down the next. He would bring me the news of the Revelation and other things, and I would do likewise.

I said: Hafsah is doomed and lost! I thought that this would happen. Then when I had prayed Fajr, I got dressed, then I went down and entered upon Hafsah, who was weeping. I said: Has the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)divorced you? She said: I do not know. He has secluded himself in this loft. I went to a black slave of his and said: Ask for permission for ‘Umar to enter. He went in, then he came out to me and said: I mentioned you to him but he did not say anything, I went away and came to the minbar, where I sat down. By it was a group of people, some of whom were weeping. I sat for a little while, then I could not bear it any longer, so I went to the slave and said: Ask for permission for ‘Umar to enter.

I got angry with my wife one day, and she started to argue with me. I did not like her to argue with me, but she said: Do you not like me to argue with you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) argue with him, and one of them will forsake him all day until night comes. I said: Any one of them who does that is doomed and lost.

He said: “Yes.” So I sat down and looked around the room, and by Allah, I did not see anything in it to please the eye except three hides. I said: Pray to Allah, O Messenger of Allah, to make life prosperous for your ummah, for He has made life prosperous for the Persians and Romans, but they do not worship Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. He sat up straight and said: “Are you doubting. O son of al-Khattab? They are people whose good things have been hastened for them in this world.” I said: Pray for forgiveness for me, O Messenger of Allah. He had sworn that he would not enter upon them for a month, because he was so annoyed with them until Allah rebuked him.";Musnad Ahmad 222, Book 2, Hadith 139;question #2;How did the cultural differences between the people of Quraish and the people of Madinah affect marital relationships?

So the Prophet (ﷺ) differed from them and departed before the sun rose.;Musnad Ahmad 275, Book 2, Hadith 187;question #2;How did the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) differ from the mushrikeen in terms of timing for departure from Jam`?
`Umar said: Allah, may He be exalted, sent Muhammad (ﷺ) and sent down the Book to him. Among that which was revealed to him was the verse of stoning. We recited it and understood it. But I fear that with the passage of time, some people will say: We do not find the verse of stoning in the Book of Allah, and as a result an obligation that Allah revealed will be forsaken. Stoning is the due punishment in the Book of Allah for those who commit zina, both men and women, if they have been married and if proof is established, or there is a pregnancy or a confession.;Musnad Ahmad 276, Book 2, Hadith 188;question #2;What is the prescribed punishment for married individuals who commit zina according to Islamic teachings?

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Recite it.” He recited it in the manner in which I had heard him recite, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Thus it was revealed.” Then he said to me: `Recite it.” So I recited it and he said: “Thus it was revealed. This Qur`an has been revealed in seven modes of recitation, so recite whatever is easy for you.`It was narrated that al Miswar bin Makhramah and `Abdur-Rahman bin Abdul-Qari heard ‘Umar say: I passed by Hisham bin Hakeem bin Hizam when he was reciting Sooratul Furqan... and he mentioned a similar hadeeth.;Musnad Ahmad 277, 278, Book 2, Hadith 189;question #2;How did the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) address differences in Quranic recitation among his companions?
"‘Umar said to me: Haven`t I been told that you do certain tasks for the state, then when you are given payment you do not accept it? He said: Yes. He said: Why do you do that? He said: I am well off and I have slaves and horses; I want my work to be a charity to the Muslims. He said: Do not do that, for I used to do what you are doing, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would give me payment, and I would say: Give it someone who is more in need of it than me, And he said: Whatever of this wealth comes to you when you are not hoping for it or asking for it, take it, otherwise do not hanker after it.”It was narrated that as-Sa`ib bin Yazeed said: `Umar met `Abdullah bin as-Sa`di... and he mentioned a similar report, but he said: “Give it in charity,” and he said: “Do not hanker after it.`";Musnad Ahmad 279, 280, Book 2, Hadith 190;question #2;How can one's work be considered a form of charity in Islam?

ʼUmar was a man of protective jealousy, and when he went out to pray, `Atikah bint Zaid would follow him, although he did not like her going out, but he did not like to stop her. He used to narrate that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `if your womenfolk ask you for permission to pray in the mosque, do not prevent them.`;Musnad Ahmad 283, Book 2, Hadith 193;question #2;How should a husband react if he feels uncomfortable with his wife's actions but they are permissible in Islam?

"I heard ‘Umar say: Do not make women`s dowries expensive, do not make women`s dowries expensive, for had this been a sign of honour in this world or piety before Allah, the first one of you to do it would have been the Prophet (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not give any of his wives, and none of his daughters were given, any more than twelve Oasiyyahs [as a dowry. And a man will go to great trouble in order to offer a high dowry to his wife.
On one occasion he said: A man would pay his wife a high dowry until he feels resentment towards her and says: You cost me everything I own, even the string to tie a waterskin and hang it up. He [the narrator] said: I was a young Arab boy with a non-Arab mother, and I did not know what a `string` was. `Umar said: And another thing you say of one who is killed in your campaigns and dies that so and so was killed as a martyr, and o and so died as a martyr. But perhaps he loaded the back of his mount with gold and silver for the purpose of trading. So do not say that, rather say what the Prophet (ﷺ) (or what Muhammad) (ﷺ) said: “Whoever is killed or dies for the sake of Allah will be in Paradise.`";Musnad Ahmad 285, Book 2, Hadith 195;question #2;How did the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) approach the matter of dowries for his wives and daughters?
"`Umar bin al-Khattab gave a speech and said: O people, we used to know you when the Prophet (ﷺ) was among us and revelation was coming down to him; Allah would tell us about you. But now the Prophet (ﷺ) has passed away and revelation has ceased, and now the way to judge you is this whoever among you shows us good conduct, we will think well of him and love him; whoever among you shows us bad conduct, we will think badly of him and hate him for that, and whatever is in your hearts is between you and your Lord. There was a time when I used to think that whoever learned the Qur`an, seeking thereby Allah and (the reward that) is with Him, would be rewarded in the Hereafter, but some men learned Qur`an seeking that which is with people. So seek Allah by learning Qur`an and by your good deeds. By Allah, I do not send my workers to strike you or seize your wealth; rather I send them to you to teach you your religion and Sunnah, whoever has done to him something other than that, let him refer it to me, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, I shall surely grant him retaliation. `Amr bin al-`As stood up and said: O Ameer al Mu`mineen, do you think if one of the Muslims was in charge of some people and he disciplined one of them, would you allow that one to settle the score with him? He said: Yes, by the One in Whose hand is the soul of `Umar, I would not certainly allow him to settle the score with him. I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) do that with regard to himself. But do not strike the Muslims and thus humiliate them, and do not keep them away from their wives on campaign for too long and thus expose them to temptation. Do not withhold from them their due rights and cause them to rebel; and do not make them camp in an area with a lot of trees, because that will cause them to be scattered.It was narrated that ‘Abul-`Ajfa` as-Sulami said: I heard ‘Umar say: Do not make women`s dowries expensive,... and he mentioned the same hadeeth.";Musnad Ahmad 286, 287, Book 2, Hadith 196;question #2;What criteria should be used to evaluate someone's character and conduct in the absence of direct revelation?

Ibn ‘Abbas came, led by a guide, who told him where Ibn ‘Umar was. He came and sat beside me, so I was between them, and we heard a voice from inside the house, Ibn `Umar said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: `The deceased is tormented because of the crying of his family.` He said: And `Abdullah understood it as general in meaning. Ibn `Abbas said: We were with Ameer al-Muʼmineen ‘Umar until we came to some arid land, where we found a man who had halted in the shade of a tree. He said to me: Go and find out for me who that man is, I went and found that it was Suhaib. I came back to him and said: You told me to find out for you who that man is; it is Suhaib. He said: Tell him to join us. I said: He has his family with him. He said: Even if he has his family with him [and perhaps Ayyoob said on one occasion:Tell him to join us). When we came to Madinah, it was not long before Ameer al Muʼmineen [ʼUmar} was attacked. Suhaib came, saying O my brother, O my friend! `Umar said: Do you not know, or have you not heard, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `The deceased is tormented because of some of his family`s crying.” “Abdullah understood it as general in meaning, but ‘Umar said: some of [their] weeping. I went to `A`ishah, and I told her what Ibn `Umar had said. She said: No, by Allah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not say, “The deceased is tormented because of the weeping of anyone.” Rather he said: “Allah increases the torment of the kafir because of his family`s weeping, and that it is He (Allah) Who makes (whom He wills) laugh, and makes (whom He wills) weep, “And no bearer of burdens shall bear another`s burden` [Al Anʼam 6:164].” Ayyoob said: Ibn Abu Mulaikah said: al-Qasim bin Muhammad told me: When `Aʼishah heard what ʼUmar and Ibn `Umar had said, she said. You are narrating to me from two who are not liars and are not to be suspected of being liars, but one may mishear.`Abdullah bin Abi Mulaikah narrated… and he mentioned a hadeeth similar to that of Ayyoob, except that he said: ibn `Umar said to `Amr bin `Uthman, when he was facing him: Why don`t you tell them not to weep? For the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `The deceased is tormented because of his family`s weeping for him.`";Musnad Ahmad 288, 289, Book 2, Hadith 197;question #2;How does the weeping of family members affect the deceased according to Islamic beliefs?

I was sitting between them and ibn `Umar said to ‘Amr bin `Uthman, who was facing him: why don`t you tell them not to weep? For I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: `The deceased is tormented because of his family`s weeping for him.` And he mentioned a hadeeth similar to that of Isma`eel from Ayyoob from Ibn Abu Mulaikah.;Musnad Ahmad 290, Book 2, Hadith 198;question #2;How can family actions affect the deceased according to Islamic teachings?

Thus it is to be given on the basis of a man`s efforts for the sake of lslam, his seniority in Islam, his support for Islam, and his need. By Allah, if I live, a shepherd in the mountains of San‘a’ will get his share of that wealth when he is tending his flock.";Musnad Ahmad 292, Book 2, Hadith 200;question #2;How does one's contribution to Islam influence their share in communal wealth?

"Learn from me three things, for I fear that the people will not come to me (before I die).

The people said to him: Appoint a successor. He said: Whatever I do, it was done by someone better than me.

I know that there are some men then who will seek to undermine this matter, and I have sought them with these two hands of mine in support of Islam. It they do that, then those are the enemies of Allah, the misguided disbelievers. By Allah, I am not leaving behind anything of more concern to me than kalalah. I asked the Prophet (ﷺ) of Allah  about it and he never spoke to me in such a harsh manner as he did with regard to that, to such an extent that he poked me in the chest or side with his hand or his finger and said: `O `Umar: The verse at the end of Soorah an Nisa’ that was revealed in summer is sufficient for you.” If I live, I will pass a judgement concerning it that no one who reads Qur`an or who does not read Qur`an will dispute.

Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, ask Him for support, for Muhammad (ﷺ) was caused to prevail on the day of Badr with fewer than your numbers.

Then he told us. Whilst we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), a man came and said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), may I draw closer? He said: `Come closer.` So he came a little closer, then he said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), may I come closer? He said: `Come closer.” So he came a little closer, then he said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), may I come closer?

He left at midday and went to ‘Umar(رضي الله عنه), and he went and came back within nineteen days. He said: Were it not that I think well of you, I would have thought that you did not convey my message. He said: Yes I did convey it, he conveys his salam and apologises, and he swore by Allah that he did not say that. He said: Did he give you any provisions? He said: No. He said: What prevented you from supplying (sufficient, provisions to me yourself? He said: I did not want to instruct that you be given the cold whilst I had the hot [i.e., I could not have given you what you wanted of food and enjoyed plentiful food myself, when around me are the people of Madinah who are starving, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  say: `No man should eat his fill when his neighbour is going without.”;Musnad Ahmad 390, Book 2, Hadith 291;question #2;How did Muhammad bin Maslamah respond to the situation at Sa`d's palace?
"I used to recite to ‘AbdurRahman bin ‘Awf, and he found me waiting for him. That was in Mina during the last Hajj performed by `Umar bin al-Khattab (رضي الله عنه) Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf said: A man came to `Umar bin al-Khattab and said: So and so is saying: If `Umar (رضي الله عنه) dies, I will swear allegiance to So and so. ʼUmar (رضي الله عنه) said: I will stand before the people today and warn them against these people who want to deprive them of their rights, `Abdur-Rahman said: I said: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, do not do that, for the Hajj season brings together the riffraff and rabble among the people, and most of the people who gather around and listen to you will be of that type. Is you stand before the people, I am afraid that you will say something that they will spread and not understand it properly or interpret it properly. Rather wait until you come to Madinah, for it is the land of Hijrah and the Sunnah, and you will meet the most knowledgeable and noble people there, and you can say what you want to say with confidence; they wilt understand what you say and will interpret it correctly, `Umar (رضي الله عنه) said: If I reach Madinah safe and sound, I shall certainly talk to the people there in the first speech I deliver. When we came to Madinah at the end of Dhul-I-Iijah, it was a Friday. I set out early, ‘Umar did not care at what time he went out, because he did not pay attention to heat and cold and so on. I found Sa`eed bin Zaid at the right-hand corner of the minbar, he had got there before me. I sat down next to him, with my knee touching his knee, and it was not long before `Umar (رضي الله عنه)came. When I saw him, I said: He will certainly speak today on this minbar and say something that no one ever heard before. Sa`eed bin Zaid objected to that and said: What do you think he will say that no one said before? `Umar (رضي الله عنه)sat on the minbar, and when the mu`dhdhin fell silent, he stood up and praised and glorified Allah as He deserves, then he said: To proceed o people, I am going to tell you something that it has been decreed I should say. I do not know, perhaps it may signal my death. So whoever understands it and remembers it, let him narrate it to others wherever his mount takes him; whoever does not understand il, it is not permissible for him to tell lies about me. Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, sent Muhammad (ﷺ) with the truth and revealed the Book to him; among the things that were revealed to him was the verse of stoning [adulterers). We read it and understood it; the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stoned [adulterers] and we stoned adulterers] after him. But I fear that with the passage of time, some people will say: We do not find the verse of stoning in the Book of Allah, thus they will go astray by forsaking an  obligation that Allah revealed. Stoning is the due punishment in the Book of Allah for those who commit zina, both men and women, if they have been married and if proof is established, or there is a pregnancy or a confession, And we used to recite: Do not claim to be the offspring of anyone other than your fathers, as it is disbelief (or ingratitude) on your part to claim to be the offspring of anyone other than your fathers, Verily the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Do not praise me excessively as `Eesa, the son of Maryam, was praised; rather I am the slave of Allah, so say, the slave of Allah and His Messenger.` I have heard that some among you are saying. If `Umar (رضي الله عنه) dies, I shall swear allegiance to So and so. No man should deceive himself by saying that the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was is successful. There is no doubt that this is the case, but Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, saved the to 2 people from its bad consequences and there is no one among you today who has the qualities of Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) What happened to us when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died was that ‘Ali, az-Zubair and those who were with them stayed behind in the house of Fatimah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and all the Ansar stayed behind and gathered in Saqeefat Banu Sa`idah, whilst the Muhajireen gathered around Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) I said to him; O Abu Bakr, let us go to our brothers, the Ansar. So we set out, looking for them, then we were met by two righteous men who told us what the people had done, and said: where are you going, O Muhajireen? I said: We are looking for these brothers of ours, the Ansar, They said. You should not go near them; do whatever you have already decided, O Muhajireen. I said: By Allah, we will go to them. So we carried on until we came to them in Saqeefat Banu Sa`idah, where we found them gathered and among them was a man wrapped up [in a garment. I said: Who is this? They said: Sa`d bin `Ubadah. ! said: What is the matter with him? They said: He is sick. After we sat down, their spokesman stood up and praised and glorified Allah, may He glorified and exalted, as He deserves, then he said: To proceed. We are the supporters (Ansar) of Allah and the majority of the Muslim army. You, O Muhajireen, are a small group among us. Some of you came to us, wanting to deny who we are and prevent us from attaining a position of authority. When he fell silent, I wanted to present a speech that I had prepared and that I liked in front of Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) I used to avoid provoking him and he was more forbearing and more dignified than me. But Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) said: Wait a while. I did not like to make him angry, and he was more knowledgeable and more dignified than me. By Allah, he did not omit any word that I liked in the speech I had prepared but he said something like it or better, speaking spontaneously, until he finished speaking. Then he said: To proceed. Whatever you have mentioned about your achievements and virtues, is correct. The Arabs would not acknowledge the leadership of anyone except someone from this tribe of Quraish, for they are the best of the Arabs in lineage and location. I am pleased to suggest to you one of these two men, whichever of them you want. Then he took hold of my hand and the hand of Abu `Ubaidah bin al-Jarrah, and I disliked nothing of what he had said apart from this, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck struck for no sin on my part than to become the leader of people among whom was Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) unless my own self suggested something at the time of death. One of the Ansar said: I am the post on which the camel with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree [i.e., a noble]. [I suggest] a ruler from among us and a ruler from among you, O Quraish. - I the narrator said to Malik; What does ‘I am the post on which the cainc! with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree` mean? He said:It is as if he is saying, I am the smart one who has the answer. - Then there was a great deal of clamour and raised voices, to such an extent that I feared there would be a conflict, so I said: Hold out your hand, O Abu Bakr. So he held out his hand and I swore allegiance to him, and the Muhajireen swore allegiance to him, then the Ansar swore allegiance to him. Thus we surrounded Sa`d bin ‘Ubadah. One of them said: You have killed Sa`d i said: May Allah kill Sa’d! And `Umar (رضي الله عنه) said: By Allah, we never encountered any problem greater than the swearing of allegiance to Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) . We were afraid that if we left the people without having sworn allegiance to anyone, they might swear allegiance after we were gone, so we would either follow in their footsteps and swear allegiance to someone we were not pleased with, or we would disagree with them and that would cause trouble. If anyone swears allegiance to a leader without consulting the Muslims, there is no allegiance for him and no allegiance to the one who swore allegiance to him, lest both of them be killed. Malik said: Ibn Shihab told me, from `Urwah bin az-Zubair, that the men whom they met were `Uwaim bin Sa`idah and Ma`n bin `Adiyy. Ibn Shihab said. Sa`eed bin al-Musayyab told me that the one who said, I am the post on which the camel with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree, was al-lubab bin al-Mundhir.";Musnad Ahmad 391, Book 3, Hadith 1;question #2;Why did 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf advise 'Umar to wait until reaching Madinah to address the people?

What made you do that? `Uthman (رضي الله عنه)said: Sometimes many soorahs would be revealed (incomplete) to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) , and when something was revealed he would call one of the scribes to write it down for him and say: “Put this in the Soorah in which such and such is mentioned`; and verses would be revealed to him and he would say, `Put these verses in the soorah in which such and such is mentioned”; and a verse would be revealed to him and he would say: `Put this verse in the soorah in which such and such is mentioned.” Al-Anfal was one of the first soorahs to be revealed in Madinah and Bara`ah was one of the last soorahs of the Qur`an, and the stories and content of the two soorahs were similar. 
Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  passed away without having stated clearly to us that it was part of it, but we thought that it was, hence I put them together and I did not put between them the line Bismillahir-Rahmanir-Raheem.

"`Abdullah bin Shaddad came and entered upon `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) when we were sitting with her, as he was returning from Iraq during the time when ‘Ali           (رضي الله عنه) was murdered. She said to him: O `Abdullah bin Shaddad, will you tell me the truth about what I am going to ask you? Tell me about these people whom ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) killed. He said: Why shouldn`t I tell you the truth? She said: Tell me about them. He said: When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) corresponded with Mu`awiyah and the two arbitrators gave their verdict, eight thousand of the pious rebelled against him and camped in a land called Haroora`, near Koofah. They criticised him and said: You have taken off a chemise that Allah caused you to wear and a title that Allah gave to you, then you went ahead and asked people to issue a decree concerning the religion of Allah. There is no ruling except the ruling of Allah, may He be exalted. When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) heard about their criticism of him and the reason why they had split from him, he told his caller not to admit anyone but those who had memorised the Qur`an. When the house was filled with people who had memorised the Qur`an, he called for a large Mushaf and put it front of him, and he started tapping it with his hand, saying: O Mushaf, tell the people. The people called out: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, how could you ask it? It is only ink and paper, but we could speak on the basis of what we understand from it. What do you want? He said: These companions of yours who rebelled, between me and them is the Book of Allah, and Allah says in His Book concerning a woman and a man: `If you fear a breach between them twain (the man and his wife), appoint (two) arbitrators, one from his family and the other from hers; if they both wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation.` [an-Nisa 4:35]. The ummah of Muhammad is more important with regard to life and sanctity than a woman and a man. They got angry with me when I wrote a document between me and Mu`awiyah and wrote `Ali bin Abi Talib [without adding the title Ameer al-Mu`mineen]. But Suhail bin `Amr came to us when we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at al-Hudaibiyah, when he made a peace deal with Quraish, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote, `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.` Suhail said: Do not write, In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He said: What should we write? He said: Write: `In Your Name, O Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Write `Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).` He [Suhail] said: If I knew that you were the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I would not have opposed you. So he wrote: This is what was agreed by Muhammad bin `Abdullah with Quraish. And Allah says in His Book: “Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day` [Al-Ahzab 33:21]. So `Ali sent `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه) to them and I went out with him until we reached the middle of their camp. Ibnul-Kawwa` stood up and addressed the people, saying: O bearers of the Qur`an, this is `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه). Whoever does not know him, I know of the Book of Allah what can tell you about him, He is one of those concerning whom the words `they are a quarrelsome people` [Az-Zukhruf 43:58] were revealed. Tell him to go back to the one who sent him and do not discuss the Book of Allah with him. Their spokesmen stood up and said: By Allah, we will discuss the Book of Allah. If he says something sound and true that we recognise we will follow him, and if he says something false we will reject his false argument. So they discussed the Book with ‘Abdullah for three days, and four thousand of them recanted and all of them repented, including Ibnul-Kawwa`. He took them to `Ali in Koofah, and `Ali sent word to the rest of them, saying: You know the turmoil between us and our opponents. Stay wherever you wish until the ummah of Muhammad (ﷺ) is united. The deal between us and you is that you should not shed any blood that it is forbidden to shed or commit acts of banditry on the roads or do wrong to any Non Muslim under Muslim protection. If you do that, we will declare war, for Allah does not love those who betray. `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) said: O Ibn Shaddad, did he kill them? He said: By Allah, no sooner had he sent this message to them but they committed acts of banditry, shed blood and regarded it as permissible to harm Ahludh-Dhimmah (non-Muslims living under Muslim protection). She said: Do you swear by Allah? He said: I swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other god that this is what happened. She said: I have heard that the people of Iraq are talking and saying dhuth-thuda, dhuth-thuda [i.e., the one with a deformed arm that looks like a breast]. He said: I saw him and I was with ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) when he was examining the slain. He called the people and said: Do you know this one? How many of them came and said: I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so, and I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so. And there was no proof of who he was except that. She said: What did `Ali say when he stood over him, as the people of Iraq claim? He said: I heard him say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. She said: Did you hear him say anything other than that? He said: No, by Allah. She said: Yes, Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. May Allah have mercy on `Ali (رضي الله عنه): it was his habit, if he saw something he liked, to say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. But the people of Iraq fabricated lies against him and added words to what he said.";Musnad Ahmad 656, Book 5, Hadith 92;question #2;How did Ali (رضي الله عنه) attempt to resolve the conflict with the rebels?

He said: “Go.` So he went then he came back and said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I did not leave in it any idol but I broke it, or any grave but i levelled it, or any image but I spoiled it.

The Prophet (ﷺ) was trying to find out about the well of Badr, and when we heard that the mushrikeen had come, the Messenger of Allah  (ﷺ) marched to Badr, and Badr was a well. We got there before the mushrikeen and we found two of their men, a man from Quraish and a freed slave of “Uqbah bin Abi Mu`ait. As for the Qurashi, he managed to escape, but we caught the freed slave of ‘Uqbah and started asking him: How many are the people? He said: By Allah, they are great in number and powerful. When he said that, the Muslims began to beat him and they brought him to the Prophet (ﷺ), who said: How many are the people? He said: By Allah, they are great in number and powerful.

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: They are one thousand; each camel is for one hundred men. Then a shower of rain fell on us at night and we rushed to seek shelter beneath the trees and leather shields, sheltering from the rain. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) spent the night calling upon his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, saying: “O Allah, if You cause this band to be destroyed, You will never be worshipped.” When dawn came, he called out: `Prayer, O slaves of Allah!” And the people came from beneath the trees and shields and the Messenger of Allah led us in prayer and encouraged us to fight.

O people, put the blame on me and say: `Utbah bin Rabee`ah is a coward, although you know that I am not the most cowardly among you. Abu Jahl heard that and said: Are you saying this? By Allah, if anyone else said this I would have insulted him; you are filled with fear, ‘Utbah said: Do you mean me, O you with the whistling rear end (i.e., one who breaks wind a great deal because of fear)? Today you will know which of us is the coward. Then ‘Utbah and his brother Shaibah and his son al-Waleed stepped forward in a display of courage and said: Who will come out to fight in single combat? Six young men of the Ansar stepped forward, but `Utbah said: We do not want these; let some of our cousins of Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib come out. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Get up, O Ali, get up, O Hamzah, get up, O `Ubaidah bin al-Harith bin ‘Abdul-Muttalib.` Allah caused `Utbah and Shaibah, the two sons of Rabee`ah, and al-Waleed bin ‘Utbah to be killed and ‘Ubaidah was wounded. We killed seventy of them and captured seventy. A short Ansari man brought al-Abbas bin `Abdul-Muttalib as a captive, and al-`Abbas said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), by Allah, this is not the one who captured me; I was captured by a bold man who was one of the most handsome of people, who was riding a piebald horse, but I do not see him among the people. The Ansari said: I captured him, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: `Be quiet!

Abu Bakr said: We started our journey at the beginning of the night and we hastened for one day and one night, until it was midday. I looked into the distance to see whether there was anywhere to seek shade, and I saw a rock, so I went to it and it had a little shade. I smoothed the ground for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and spread a garment of camel hair for him, and said: Lie down and rest, O Messenger of Allah. So he lay down, and I went out to see if I could spot anyone looking for us. Then I saw a shepherd and I said: Who do you belong to, O boy? He said: To a man of Quraish. He mentioned his name and I recognised it. I said: Is there any milk in your sheep? He said: Yes | said: Will you milk some for me? He said: Yes. I told him to do that, so he caught a sheep, then I told him to brush the dust from its teat, then to brush the dust off his hands. I had a small vessel with me on the neck of which was a cloth. He milked a little bit of milk for me and I poured it into the vessel until it cooled down. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When I reached him, he had already woken up. I said: Drink, O Messenger of Allah. He drank until I was pleased, then I said: Is it time to move on? So we moved on and the people were coming after us but none of them caught up with us except Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju'shum, who was riding a horse of his, I said: O Messenger of Allah, someone has caught up with us. He said: `Do not be afraid, for Allah is with us.` When he got close to us, and there was no more between us and him then the length of a spear or two or three spears, I said: O Messenger of Allah, this pursuer has caught up with us, and I wept. He said: `Why are you weeping?` I said: I am not weeping for myself; rather I am weeping for you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed against him [the pursuer] and said: “O Allah, protect us from him by whatever means You will.” Then his horse's legs sank into the solid ground up to its belly, and he fell off it. He said: O Muhammad, I know that this is because of you; pray to Allah to save me from my predicament, and by Allah I shall divert away from you any one who is behind me of those who are seeking you. Here is my quiver, take one arrow. You are going to pass by some camels and sheep of mine in such and such a place, take whatever you need from thern. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `I have no need of it.“ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed for him and he was released, and he went back to his companions. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and I continued on our way until we came to Madinah, where the people met him. They came out on the road and on the roofs, and a lot of servants and children crowded the road saying: Allahu Akbar, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has come, Muhammad has come. The people disputed as to who he would stay with. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Tonight I will stay with Banun-Najjar, the maternal uncles of 'Abdul-Muttalib, to honour them thereby.” The next morning, he went where he was instructed. Al-Bara' bin 'Azib said: The first of the Muhajireen to come to us was Mus'ab bin 'Umair, the brother of Banu 'Abdud-Dar. Then Ibn Umm Maktoom, the blind man and brother of Banu Fihr, came to us. Then 'Umar bin al-Khattab, came to us with twenty riders and we said: What happened to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? He said: He is behind me.

Al-Bara said: the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not come until I had read some soorahs from al-Mufassal [Al-Mufassal is that portion of the Qur'an which goes from Qaf to an-Nas].

He went around doing that for three days, then [the Prophet (ﷺ) said to ‘Ali; “Go and catch up with him; send Abu Bakr back to me and you convey it.” So he did that.

Then he sat where he was until he had prayed Zuhr, 'Asr and Maghrib, and he did not speak until he had prayed 'isha'. Then he got up and went to his family. The people said to Abu Bakr: Why don't you ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) what is the matter? He did something today that he never did before. So he asked him and he said: `Yes, I was shown what is to come of this world and the Hereafter. The earlier and later generations were gathered in one place and the people got terrified because of that. They went to Adam when the sweat was about to reach their mouths, and they said: O Adam, you are the father of mankind and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose you. Intercede for us with your Lord, He said: I am in the same position as you. Go to your father after your father, to Nooh, “Allah chose Adam, Nooh (Noah), the family of Ibraheem (Abraham) and the family of 'Imran above the 'Alameen (mankind and jinn) (of their times)` (Al 'Imran 3:33}.

Then they will go to Nooh and will say: Intercede with your Lord for us, for Allah chose you and answered your supplication, and He did not leave one of the disbelievers on the Earth (cf. 71:26). He will say: I am not the one you want; go to Ibraheem for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, took him as a close friend (khaleel). So they will go to Ibraheem but he will say: I am not the one you want; go to Moosa, for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, spoke directly to him (cf. 4:164). But Moosa will say: I am not the one you want; go to 'Eesa Ibn Maryam, for he healed those born blind and the lepers, and he brought forth the dead. But 'Eesa will say: I am not the one you want; go to the leader of the sons of Adam, for he is the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection. Go to Muhammad, for he will intercede for you with your Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. Then (the Prophet) will go and Jibreel will come to his Lord and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Give him permission and give him the glad tidings of Paradise. Jibreel will take him and he will fall down in prostration for a week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intercession will be accepted. So he will raise his head, and when he looks at his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, he will fall down in prostration for another week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intersession will be accepted. He will start to fall down in prostration again, but Jibreel (peace be upon him) will take hold of his upper arms and Allah, may he be glorified and exalted, will inspire him to offer a supplication such as no human being was ever inspired with. He will say: `O Lord, You created me as the leader of the sons of Adam, and no boast; the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection, and no boast; there will come to my Cistern more people than there can be between San‘a’ and Allah (Eilat).` Then it will be said: Call the Siddeeq's so that they might intercede. Then it will be said: Call the Prophets. So one Prophet will come with a group, and another Prophet will come with five or six people, and another Prophet will come with nobody. Then it will be said: Call the martyrs so that they might intercede for whoever they want. When the martyrs do that, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: I am the Most Merciful of those who show mercy; I admit to My Paradise anyone who does not associate anything with Me.

So they will enter Paradise. Then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look in Hell; can you find anyone who ever did anything good? And they will find a man in Hell, and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that I was easy-going with people in buying and selling. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Be easy-going with My slave as he was easygoing with My slaves. Then they will bring a man out of Hell and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that l instructed my sons: When I die, burn me with fire, then grind me until I am like kohl powder. Then take me to the sea and scatter me in the wind, for by Allah the Lord of the Worlds will never be able to punish me. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Why did you do that? He will say: For fear of You. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look at the kingdom of the greatest king and you will have the like thereof and ten times as much. He will say: Are You making fun of me when You are the Sovereign? He (the Prophet (ﷺ) said: “That is what I was smiling at, at the time of the foremoon.`";Musnad Ahmad 15, Book 1, Hadith 15;question #3;What qualities or actions might lead to a person being granted entry into Paradise according to Islamic teachings?

Ask Allah to keep you safe and sound, for no one is given anything, after certain faith (yaqeen) that is better than being kept safe and sound.` Then he said: “Do not sever ties with one another, do not turn your backs on one another, do not bear grudges against one another, do not envy one another, and be, O slaves of Allah, brothers.`;Musnad Ahmad 17, Book 1, Hadith 17;question #3;Why is asking Allah for safety and soundness considered important after having certain faith?

'Uthman said: I was one of them. Whilst I was sitting in the shade of a small fort, ‘Umar passed by me and greeted me, and I did not realise that he had passed me or greeted me, ‘Umar went to Abu Bakr and said to him: Do you think it is right that I passed by ‘Uthman and greeted him and he did not return my greeting?

If what is due from him is a she-camel in its fourth year and he only has a she camel in its fifth year, it should be accepted from him and the zakat collector should give him back twenty dirhams or two sheep.

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “No one who mistreats his slaves will enter Paradise.` Aman said: O Messenger of Allah, didn't you tell us that this ummah is the greatest in numbers of slaves and orphans? He said: `Yes, so treat them kindly as you treat your children and feed them from what you eat.` They said: What could benefit us in this world, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “A good horse which you keep ready for fighting for the sake of Allah and a slave to take care of you. If he prays (becomes Muslim), then he is your brother, if he prays, then he is your brother.”;Musnad Ahmad 75, Book 1, Hadith 71;question #3;What are the benefits mentioned for Muslims in this world according to the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)?
‘Umar has come to me and told me that casualties were heavy at al-Yamamah among the Muslims who knew the Qur'an by heart, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Muslims who know the Qur'an by heart on other battlefields and a large part of the Qur’an may be lost. I ['Umar] think that you [Abu Bakr should issue instructions that the Qur'an be collected. I said to ‘Umar. How can I do anything that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not do? He said: By Allah, it is a good thing. And he kept urging me to do that until Allah opened my heart to it and I came around to 'Umar's point of view. Zaid said: And ‘Umar was sitting with him, not speaking. Abu Bakr said: You are a wise young man and we trust you. You used to write down the revelation for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), so collect it. Zaid said: By Allah, if they had ordered me to move a mountain, that would not have been more difficult for me than what they instructed me to do of collecting the Qur'an. I said: How can you do anything that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not do?;Musnad Ahmad 76, Book 1, Hadith 72;question #3;What qualities did Abu Bakr see in Zaid bin Thabit that made him suitable for the task of collecting the Qur'an?
When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died and Abu Bakr was appointed as caliph, al-'Abbas disputed with ‘Ali concerning some things that the Messenger of Allah: had left behind. Abu Bakr said: It is something that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) left the way it is and I am not going to introduce any changes to it. When 'Umar was appointed as caliph, they referred the dispute to him and he said: It is something that Abu Bakr did not change and I am not going to change it.

So he gave it to him.;Musnad Ahmad 77, Book 1, Hadith 73;question #3;What approach did 'Umar take when faced with the same dispute during his caliphate?

I know what you are going to say. You are going to say: He (the Prophet (ﷺ)) is the son of my brother and I should have half of the wealth. And I know what you are going to say, O 'Ali. You are going to say: His daughter is married to me and she should have half of the wealth. This is what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had, and we saw how he managed it. Then Abu Bakr took charge of it after him, and he dealt with it in the same way as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had dealt with it. Then I took charge after Abu Bakr and I swear by Allah that I will strive my best to deal with it as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr to dealt with it. Then he said: Abu Bakr told me and he swore by Allah that he was telling the truth, that he heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say: `The Prophet is not to be inherited from; rather his estate is to go to the poor and needy Muslims.` And Abu Bakr told me and swore by Allah that he was telling the truth, that the Prophet (ﷺ) Said: 'No Prophet dies until he has been led in prayer by one of his ummah.` This is what was in the possession of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and we saw how he dealt with it. If you wish, I will give it to you to manage it in the same way as the Messenger of Al!ah (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr did, so that I can put it under your control. They discussed it privately, then they came and al-'Abbas said: Give it to ‘Ali, for I am happy for him to take control of it.";Musnad Ahmad 78, Book 1, Hadith 74;question #3;What does the hadith imply about the inheritance rights of the Prophet's family?

The people gathered and he ascended the minbar, which was something that was made for him to deliver speeches, and it was the first speech he gave in Islam. He praised and glorified Allah, then he said: O People, I wish that someone else could have taken care of this for me, for if you compare my way to the way of your Prophet (ﷺ), I cannot be like him, for he was protected from the shaitan and the revelation used to come to him from heaven.;Musnad Ahmad 80, Book 1, Hadith 76;question #3;What challenges did Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq face in comparison to the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)?
Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded me to say, in the morning, in the evening and when I went to bed at night: `O Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth. Knower of the unseen and the seen. You are the Lord and Sovereign of all things. I bear witness that there is no god but You alone with no partner or associate, and that Muhammad is Your slave and Your Messenger. I seek refuge in You from the evil of my own self and the evil of the shaitan and the shirk to which he calls, and lest I wrong myself or wrong another Muslim.`;Musnad Ahmad 81, Book 1, Hadith 77;question #3;What is the importance of acknowledging Allah as the Creator and Knower of the unseen and seen in daily supplications?
Some people from Syria came to ‘Umar and said: We have acquired wealth and horses and slaves,and we want to pay zakah on them as a purification. He said: I shall do what my two predecessors did.

So it was said to him: Go for Haji and 'Umrah, then go for jihad. So he set out and when he was in al-Hawa'it, he entered ihram for both Haji and 'Umrah together, Zaid bin Soohan and Salman bin Rabee'ah saw him and said: He is more astray than his camel, or he is no more guided than his camel. He went to ‘Umar and told him what they had said. He said: You have been guided to the Sunnah of your Prophet  (ﷺ) . Al-Hakam said: I said to Abu Wa'il. Did as-Subayy tell you that? He said: Yes;Musnad Ahmad 83, Book 2, Hadith 2;question #3;How does the concept of guidance to the Sunnah manifest in this narration?

"My father said: I told Ibn 'Abbas and he said: What is so amazing about that? When ʼUmar called the prominent shaikhs among the Companions of Muhammad ﷺ, he would call me with them and say: Do not speak until they have spoken. He called us one day or one night and said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ  said about Lailatal-Qadr what you know, so seek it in the odd numbered nights of the last ten nights; on which odd-numbered night do you think it is?";Musnad Ahmad 85, Book 2, Hadith 4;question #3;How did ʼUmar involve young companions like Ibn 'Abbas in discussions with senior companions?

We have come to you to ask you about three things: A man's nafl prayer in his house, Ghusl in the case of janabah, and what it is appropriate for a man to do with his wife when she is menstruating. He said: Are you magicians? You have asked me about something that no one has asked me about since I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about it, and he said:  `A man's nafl prayer in his house is light, so whoever wishes, let him illuminate his house.` And he said with regard to ghusl in the case of janabah: `Let him wash his private parts, then do wudoo', then pour water over his head three times.` And he said concerning the menstruating woman: `The [Husband may enjoy] whatever is above the izar (waist wrapper).`;Musnad Ahmad 86, Book 2, Hadith 5;question #3;How should a husband interact with his wife during her menstruation period according to Islamic guidance?

"I saw a dream that I can only interpret as meaning that my death is near; I saw as if a rooster pecked me twice, and I was told that it was a red rooster. I told this dream to Asma’ bint 'Umais, the wife of Abu Bakr , and she said: You will be killed by a Persian man. The people are asking me to appoint a successor, but Allah will not cause His religion and His caliphate, with which He sent His Prophet ﷺ to be lost. If death comes to me soon, then the caliphate is to be decided by these six men with whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was pleased when he died. Whichever of them you swear allegiance to, then listen to him and obey. I know that some people will object to this matter. I have fought them with my own hands in the defence of Islam. 
They are the enemies of Allah and misguided kafirs. By Allah, I am not leaving behind anything that my Lord instructed me to do and I came to the position of caliphate on that basis that is more important to me than kalalah. By Allah, the Prophet of Allah ﷺ never emphasised any issue to me since I accompanied him more than the issue of kalalah, until he poked me in the chest with his finger and said: `Is not ayatas-saif (the verse of summer, i.e., it was revealed in summer), which appears at the end of Sooratan Nisa', sufficient for you?` If I live I will issue a decree that will be so clear that those who read the Qur'an and those who do not read it will be able to make decisions concerning it. I call upon Allah to bear witness over the governors of the regions, for I only sent them to be just and to teach the people their religion and the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ and to refer to me concerning any difficult matter. O people, you eat two plants which I find to be nothing but repugnant, this onion and garlic. I remember the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, if he noticed their smell coming from a man in the mosque, he would issue orders that he taken out from the mosque to al-Baqee'. Whoever must eat them, let him cook them to death.” 

He said: He addressed the people on Friday and was attacked on Wednesday.";Musnad Ahmad 89, Book 2, Hadith 8;question #3;What role do the six companions mentioned by 'Umar play in the decision-making process for the caliphate?

Then he stood and addressed the people, and said: O people, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made a deal with the Jews of Khaibar on the basis that we could expel them whenever we want. They have attacked 'Abdullah bin ‘Umar and dislocated his arms, as you heard about their attack on the Ansari before him. We do not doubt that they are the ones who did it, as we have no other enemy but them. Whoever has property in Khaibar, let him go there, for I am going to expel the Jews. Then he expelled them.;Musnad Ahmad 90, Book 2, Hadith 9;question #3;How did 'Umar identify the perpetrators of the attack on 'Abdullah bin 'Umar?

And the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was smiling until when I had said too much, he said: `Move away from me, O ‘Umar, for I was given the choice and I have chosen. It was said: `Whether you (O Muhammad) ask forgiveness for them (hypocrites) or ask not forgiveness for them- (and even) if you ask seventy times for their forgiveness-Allah will not forgive them' [at-Tawbah 9:80].

He said: I was astounded that I had spoken so audaciously to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ; Allah and His Messenger know best. By Allah, it was not long before these two verses were revealed: “And never (O Muhammad pray (funeral prayer) for any of them (hypocrites) who dies, nor stand at his grave. Certainly they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and died while they were Fasiqoon (rebellious, - disobedient to AIlah and His Messenger).`[at-Tawbah9:84]. So after that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ did not offer the funeral prayer for any hypocrite or stand by his grave until he passed away.";Musnad Ahmad 95, Book 2, Hadith 14;question #3;How did the revelation of specific Quranic verses influence the Prophet's ﷺ actions regarding funeral prayers for hypocrites?

I want my work to be an act of charity towards the Muslims. 'Umar said: Do not do that, for I wanted to do the same as you want to do. The Prophet ﷺ would give me some payment and I would say: Give it to one who is more in need of it than me. One day he gave me something and I said: Give it to one who is more in need of it than me. The Prophet ﷺ said: `Take it, keep it, and give it in charity, Whatever of this wealth comes to you when you are not hoping for it or asking for it, accept it, but if it does not come to you, do not hope for it.”;Musnad Ahmad 100, Book 2, Hadith 19;question #3;What guidance did the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ provide regarding the acceptance and distribution of wealth?

Then he recited: `That this is verily, the word of an honoured Messenger [i.e. Jibreel (Gabriel) or Muhammad which he has brought from Allah]. It is not the word of a poet, little is that you believe!” [al-Haqqah 69:40-41]. I said: (He is a) soothsayer. He said: “Nor is it the word of a soothsayer (or a foreteller), little is that you remember! This is the Revelation sent down from the Lord of the 'Alameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists). And if he (Muhammad ﷺ) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah). We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), And then We certainly would have cut off his life artery (aorta), And none of you could have withheld Us from (punishing) him...” [al-Haqqah 69:42—47]. lle said: Then I felt an overwhelming attraction to Islam.;Musnad Ahmad 107, Book 2, Hadith 25;question #3;What does the Qur'an say about the authenticity of the revelations received by Prophet Muhammad?

He said: (And I asked) about stories (for preaching), because they wanted me to tell them stories. He said: Whatever you want. It was as if he did not want to tell him not to do that. He said: I only wanted to follow what you say. He said: I am afraid that if you tell them stories (for preaching), you will think that you are better than them, then you will tell them stories and think that you are better than them, until you imagine that you are as far above them as the Pleiades, then Allah will put you that far beneath their feet on the Day of Resurrection.;Musnad Ahmad 111, Book 2, Hadith 29;question #3;What advice is given regarding telling stories for preaching purposes?

I heard 'Umar bin al-Khattab say to Talhah bin‘Ubaidullah: Why do I see you looking unkempt and dusty since the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died? Perhaps you were upset about your cousin becoming caliph?

I am the most unlikely among you to feel like that, I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: `I know a word which, if a man says it when dying his soul will find rest and provision when it comes out from his body and it will be light for him on the Day of Resurrection.” I did not ask the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about it and he did not tell me it.

O Allah, accomplish for me what You have promised me!

So and so ­ a relative of ʼUmar's- ­ over 
to me so that I may strike his neck. You should hand ‘Aqeel over to ‘Ali so that he may strike his neck, and you should hand over So and so to Hamzah (his brother) so that he may strike his neck, so that Allah will know that we have no mercy in our hearts towards the mushrikeen; these are 
their prominent figures and leaders. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  inclined towards the view of Abu Bakr, and he did not incline towards what I said, and accepted ransoms from them.

If I find it is a cause for weeping, I will weep too, and is it is not, then I will make myself weep with you.

I have been shown your punishment as close as this tree` ­ a tree that was close to the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) Then Allah revealed the words:`It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land.

I think that you should hand so and so—a relative of ‘Umar's—to me so that I may strike his neck, You should hand ‘Aqeel over to ‘Ali so that he may strike his neck, and you should hand over so and so to Hamzah (his brother) so that he may strike his neck, so that Allah will know that we have no mercy in our hearts towards the mushrikeen; these are their prominent figures and leaders. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) inclined towards the view of Abu Bakr, and he did not incline towards what I said, and accepted ransoms from them. The next day. I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and found him with Abu Bakr, and they were both weeping. I said, “O Messenger of Allah, tell me why you and your companion are weeping. If I find it is a cause for weeping. I will weep too, and if it is not, then I will make myself weep with you.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, “I am weeping because of what your companions suggested about accepting a ransom for the prisoners. I have been shown your punishment as close as this tree”—a tree that was close to the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ). Then Allah revealed the words: “It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land. You desire the good of this world (i.e. the money of ransom for freeing the captives), but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter, And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. Were it not a previous ordainment from Allah, a severe torment would have touched you for what you took.” [al-Anfal 8:67-68] i.e., referring to the ransom. Then booty was permitted to them, and when the day of Uhud came the following year, they were punished for what they had done for taking the ransom on the day of Badr. Seventy of them were killed and the Companions of the Prophet deserted him; his front tooth was broken and the helmet on his head was broken, and blood flowed down his face, and Allah revealed the words: “When a single disaster smites you, although you smote (your enemies) with one twice as great, you say: ‘From where does this come to us?’ Say (to them), ‘It is from yourselves (because of your evil deeds).’ And Allah has power over all things” [Al ‘Imran 3:165];Musnad Ahmad 221, Book 2, Hadith 138;question #3;What differing opinions did Abu Bakr and Umar have regarding the treatment of prisoners after the Battle of Badr?
"I was eager to ask 'Umar about the two wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) concerning whom Allah said, “If you two (wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) turn in repentance
to Allah, (it will be better for you), your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet (ﷺ) likes)” [at-Tahreem 66:4], until 'Umar went for Hajj and I went with him. When we were partway there, 'Umar turned aside and I turned aside with him, bringing the jug. He relieved himself, then he came to me and I poured water onto his hands, and he did wudoo’. I said: “O Ameer al -Mu'mineen, who are the two wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) of whom Allah said: ‘If you two (wives of the Prophet (ﷺ)) turn in repentance to Allah, (it will be better for you), your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet (ﷺ) likes)’?” [at-Tahreem 66:4] 'Umar said, “How strange of you, O Ibn  'Abbas”, (az-Zuhri said: By Allah, he did not like the question, but he did not conceal anything.) He said, “They were Hafsah and 'A'ishah.” Then he started to narrate the hadeeth and said: We people of Quraish were a people who dominated women, but when we came to Madinah we found a people who were dominated by their women, and our women started to learn from their women. My house was among Banu Umayyah bin Zaid in al-'Awali. One day I got angry with my wife, and she argued with me. I did not like her to argue with me, but she said: Do you not like me to argue with you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) argue with him, and one of them will forsake him all day until night comes, I went and entered upon Hafsah, and I said: Do
you argue with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? She said: Yes. I said: Does one of you forsake him all day until night comes? She said: Yes. I said: Any one of you who does that is doomed and lost. Does any one of you feel assured that Allah will not be angry with her because of the anger of His
Messenger (ﷺ), for then she will be doomed? Do not argue with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and do not ask him for anything. Ask me for whatever you want. And do not be misled by the fact that your neighbour is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) than
you – referring to 'A'ishah. And ‘Umar said: I had a neighbour among the Ansar. We used to take turns to go down to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He would go down one day and I would go down the next. He would bring me the news of the Revelation and other things, and I would do likewise.
We were saying that Ghassan were shoeing their horses to attack us. My friend went down, then he came to me at night and knocked on my door, then he called out to me. I went out to him and he said: Something terrible has happened! I said: What? Have Ghassan come? He said: No, it is more terrible than that and worse. The Prophet (ﷺ) has divorced his wives! I said: Hafsah is doomed and lost! I thought that this would happen. Then when I had prayed Fajr, I got dressed, then I went down and entered upon Hafsah, who was weeping. I said: Has the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)divorced you? She said: I do not know. He has secluded himself in this loft. I went to a black slave of his and said: Ask for permission for ‘Umar to enter. He went in, then he came out to me and said: I mentioned you to him but he did not say anything, I went away and came to the minbar, where I sat down. By it was a group of people, some of whom were weeping. I sat for a little while, then I could not bear it any longer, so I went to the slave and said: Ask for permission for ‘Umar to enter. He went in, then he came out to me and said: I mentioned you to him but he did not say anything. I turned to leave, then the slave called me and said: Go in, he has given you permission. So I went in and greeted the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with salam. He was resting on a reed mat that had left marks on his side. I said: O Messenger of Allah, have you divorced your wives? He looked up at me and said, “No.” I said: Allah Akbar! if you had seen us, O Messenger of Allah, we Quraish were a people who dominated women, but when we came to Madinah we found a people who were dominated by their women, and our women started to learn from their women. I got angry with my wife one day, and she started to argue with me. I did not like her to argue with me, but she said: Do you not like me to argue with you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) argue with him, and one of them will forsake him all day until night comes. I said: Any one of them who does that is doomed and lost. Does one of them feel assured that Allah will not be angry with her because of the anger of His Messenger (ﷺ),then she will be doomed? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled. I said: O Messenger of Allah, I entered upon Hafsah and I said: Do not be misled by the fact that your neighbour (i.e. ‘Aa'ishah) is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) than you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled again. I said: O Messenger of Allah, may I speak to you freely? He said: “Yes.” So I sat down and looked around the room, and by Allah, I did not see anything in it to please the eye except three hides. I said: Pray to Allah, O Messenger of Allah, to make life prosperous for your ummah, for He has made life prosperous for the Persians and Romans, but they do not worship Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. He sat up straight and said: “Are you doubting. O son of al-Khattab? They are people whose good things have been hastened for them in this world.” I said: Pray for forgiveness for me, O Messenger of Allah. He had sworn that he would not enter upon them for a month, because he was so annoyed with them until Allah rebuked him.";Musnad Ahmad 222, Book 2, Hadith 139;question #3;What was Umar's reaction upon hearing the news about the Prophet's decision regarding his wives?

We never competed in doing good deeds but Abu Bakr beat us to it.";Musnad Ahmad 265, Book 2, Hadith 179;question #3;What significance does the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) place on the recitation of Abdullah bin Mas'ood?
"When the people of Yemen came, ‘Umar started asking people in the group, Is there anyone among you from Qaran, until he came to [the tribe of Qaran] and said: Who are you? They said: Qaran.

He said: Rather you should pray for forgiveness for me; you are the Companion of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). ʼUmar (e.) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: `The best of the Tabi`een will be a man called Uwais who has a mother, and he has some whiteness, then he prayed to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and He took it away, except for an area the size of a dirham near his navel.” So he prayed for forgiveness for him, then he disappeared in a group of people and no one knew where he ended up. Then he (Uwais) came to Koofah. We used to gather in a circle, remembering Allah, and he would sit with us, and when he spoke of Allah, his words would have an impact on us like that of no one else.

I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when he was in al-Batha` and he said: `What did you enter ihram for?` I said: I have entered ihram for the same as the Prophet (ﷺ) did. He said: `Have you brought a sacrificial animal?` I said: No. He said: “Circumambulate the House and go between as-Safa and al-Marwah, then exit ihraam.” So I circumambulated the House and went between as-Safa and al-Marwah, then I went to a woman of my people and she combed my hair and washed my head.

`Umar said: Allah, may He be exalted, sent Muhammad (ﷺ) and sent down the Book to him. Among that which was revealed to him was the verse of stoning. We recited it and understood it. But I fear that with the passage of time, some people will say: We do not find the verse of stoning in the Book of Allah, and as a result an obligation that Allah revealed will be forsaken. Stoning is the due punishment in the Book of Allah for those who commit zina, both men and women, if they have been married and if proof is established, or there is a pregnancy or a confession.;Musnad Ahmad 276, Book 2, Hadith 188;question #3;What are the conditions under which the punishment of stoning is applied in Islamic law?

"‘Umar said to me: Haven`t I been told that you do certain tasks for the state, then when you are given payment you do not accept it? He said: Yes. He said: Why do you do that? He said: I am well off and I have slaves and horses; I want my work to be a charity to the Muslims. He said: Do not do that, for I used to do what you are doing, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would give me payment, and I would say: Give it someone who is more in need of it than me, And he said: Whatever of this wealth comes to you when you are not hoping for it or asking for it, take it, otherwise do not hanker after it.”It was narrated that as-Sa`ib bin Yazeed said: `Umar met `Abdullah bin as-Sa`di... and he mentioned a similar report, but he said: “Give it in charity,” and he said: “Do not hanker after it.`";Musnad Ahmad 279, 280, Book 2, Hadith 190;question #3;What guidance does Islam provide regarding wealth that comes without seeking or hoping for it?

"I heard ‘Umar say: Do not make women`s dowries expensive, do not make women`s dowries expensive, for had this been a sign of honour in this world or piety before Allah, the first one of you to do it would have been the Prophet (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not give any of his wives, and none of his daughters were given, any more than twelve Oasiyyahs [as a dowry. And a man will go to great trouble in order to offer a high dowry to his wife.
On one occasion he said: A man would pay his wife a high dowry until he feels resentment towards her and says: You cost me everything I own, even the string to tie a waterskin and hang it up. He [the narrator] said: I was a young Arab boy with a non-Arab mother, and I did not know what a `string` was. `Umar said: And another thing you say of one who is killed in your campaigns and dies that so and so was killed as a martyr, and o and so died as a martyr. But perhaps he loaded the back of his mount with gold and silver for the purpose of trading. So do not say that, rather say what the Prophet (ﷺ) (or what Muhammad) (ﷺ) said: “Whoever is killed or dies for the sake of Allah will be in Paradise.`";Musnad Ahmad 285, Book 2, Hadith 195;question #3;What are the potential consequences of demanding high dowries in marriage?
"`Umar bin al-Khattab gave a speech and said: O people, we used to know you when the Prophet (ﷺ) was among us and revelation was coming down to him; Allah would tell us about you. But now the Prophet (ﷺ) has passed away and revelation has ceased, and now the way to judge you is this whoever among you shows us good conduct, we will think well of him and love him; whoever among you shows us bad conduct, we will think badly of him and hate him for that, and whatever is in your hearts is between you and your Lord. There was a time when I used to think that whoever learned the Qur`an, seeking thereby Allah and (the reward that) is with Him, would be rewarded in the Hereafter, but some men learned Qur`an seeking that which is with people. So seek Allah by learning Qur`an and by your good deeds. By Allah, I do not send my workers to strike you or seize your wealth; rather I send them to you to teach you your religion and Sunnah, whoever has done to him something other than that, let him refer it to me, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, I shall surely grant him retaliation. `Amr bin al-`As stood up and said: O Ameer al Mu`mineen, do you think if one of the Muslims was in charge of some people and he disciplined one of them, would you allow that one to settle the score with him? He said: Yes, by the One in Whose hand is the soul of `Umar, I would not certainly allow him to settle the score with him. I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) do that with regard to himself. But do not strike the Muslims and thus humiliate them, and do not keep them away from their wives on campaign for too long and thus expose them to temptation. Do not withhold from them their due rights and cause them to rebel; and do not make them camp in an area with a lot of trees, because that will cause them to be scattered.It was narrated that ‘Abul-`Ajfa` as-Sulami said: I heard ‘Umar say: Do not make women`s dowries expensive,... and he mentioned the same hadeeth.";Musnad Ahmad 286, 287, Book 2, Hadith 196;question #3;What is the significance of learning the Qur'an with the intention of seeking Allah's reward rather than worldly gains?
"I was sitting beside Ibn ‘Umar, and we were waiting for the funeral of Umm Aban bint `Uthman bin `Affan. `Amr bin `Uthman was also present. Ibn ‘Abbas came, led by a guide, who told him where Ibn ‘Umar was. He came and sat beside me, so I was between them, and we heard a voice from inside the house, Ibn `Umar said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: `The deceased is tormented because of the crying of his family.` He said: And `Abdullah understood it as general in meaning.

He said to me: Go and find out for me who that man is, I went and found that it was Suhaib. I came back to him and said: You told me to find out for you who that man is; it is Suhaib. He said: Tell him to join us. I said: He has his family with him. He said: Even if he has his family with him [and perhaps Ayyoob said on one occasion:Tell him to join us).

I went to `A`ishah, and I told her what Ibn `Umar had said. She said: No, by Allah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not say, “The deceased is tormented because of the weeping of anyone.” Rather he said: “Allah increases the torment of the kafir because of his family`s weeping, and that it is He (Allah) Who makes (whom He wills) laugh, and makes (whom He wills) weep, “And no bearer of burdens shall bear another`s burden` [Al Anʼam 6:164].” Ayyoob said: Ibn Abu Mulaikah said: al-Qasim bin Muhammad told me: When `Aʼishah heard what ʼUmar and Ibn `Umar had said, she said. You are narrating to me from two who are not liars and are not to be suspected of being liars, but one may mishear.`Abdullah bin Abi Mulaikah narrated… and he mentioned a hadeeth similar to that of Ayyoob, except that he said: ibn `Umar said to `Amr bin `Uthman, when he was facing him: Why don`t you tell them not to weep?

I was sitting between them and ibn `Umar said to ‘Amr bin `Uthman, who was facing him: why don`t you tell them not to weep?

Thus it is to be given on the basis of a man`s efforts for the sake of lslam, his seniority in Islam, his support for Islam, and his need.

He said: Were it not that I think well of you, I would have thought that you did not convey my message. He said: Yes I did convey it, he conveys his salam and apologises, and he swore by Allah that he did not say that. He said: Did he give you any provisions? He said: No. He said: What prevented you from supplying (sufficient, provisions to me yourself? He said: I did not want to instruct that you be given the cold whilst I had the hot [i.e., I could not have given you what you wanted of food and enjoyed plentiful food myself, when around me are the people of Madinah who are starving, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  say: `No man should eat his fill when his neighbour is going without.”;Musnad Ahmad 390, Book 2, Hadith 291;question #3;What was Sa`d's reaction when he learned about the actions taken by Muhammad bin Maslamah?
"I used to recite to ‘AbdurRahman bin ‘Awf, and he found me waiting for him. That was in Mina during the last Hajj performed by `Umar bin al-Khattab (رضي الله عنه) Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf said: A man came to `Umar bin al-Khattab and said: So and so is saying: If `Umar (رضي الله عنه) dies, I will swear allegiance to So and so. ʼUmar (رضي الله عنه) said: I will stand before the people today and warn them against these people who want to deprive them of their rights, `Abdur-Rahman said: I said: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, do not do that, for the Hajj season brings together the riffraff and rabble among the people, and most of the people who gather around and listen to you will be of that type. Is you stand before the people, I am afraid that you will say something that they will spread and not understand it properly or interpret it properly. Rather wait until you come to Madinah, for it is the land of Hijrah and the Sunnah, and you will meet the most knowledgeable and noble people there, and you can say what you want to say with confidence; they wilt understand what you say and will interpret it correctly, `Umar (رضي الله عنه) said: If I reach Madinah safe and sound, I shall certainly talk to the people there in the first speech I deliver. When we came to Madinah at the end of Dhul-I-Iijah, it was a Friday. I set out early, ‘Umar did not care at what time he went out, because he did not pay attention to heat and cold and so on. I found Sa`eed bin Zaid at the right-hand corner of the minbar, he had got there before me. I sat down next to him, with my knee touching his knee, and it was not long before `Umar (رضي الله عنه)came. When I saw him, I said: He will certainly speak today on this minbar and say something that no one ever heard before. Sa`eed bin Zaid objected to that and said: What do you think he will say that no one said before? `Umar (رضي الله عنه)sat on the minbar, and when the mu`dhdhin fell silent, he stood up and praised and glorified Allah as He deserves, then he said: To proceed o people, I am going to tell you something that it has been decreed I should say. I do not know, perhaps it may signal my death. So whoever understands it and remembers it, let him narrate it to others wherever his mount takes him; whoever does not understand il, it is not permissible for him to tell lies about me. Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, sent Muhammad (ﷺ) with the truth and revealed the Book to him; among the things that were revealed to him was the verse of stoning [adulterers). We read it and understood it; the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stoned [adulterers] and we stoned adulterers] after him. But I fear that with the passage of time, some people will say: We do not find the verse of stoning in the Book of Allah, thus they will go astray by forsaking an  obligation that Allah revealed. Stoning is the due punishment in the Book of Allah for those who commit zina, both men and women, if they have been married and if proof is established, or there is a pregnancy or a confession, And we used to recite: Do not claim to be the offspring of anyone other than your fathers, as it is disbelief (or ingratitude) on your part to claim to be the offspring of anyone other than your fathers, Verily the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Do not praise me excessively as `Eesa, the son of Maryam, was praised; rather I am the slave of Allah, so say, the slave of Allah and His Messenger.` I have heard that some among you are saying. If `Umar (رضي الله عنه) dies, I shall swear allegiance to So and so. No man should deceive himself by saying that the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was is successful. There is no doubt that this is the case, but Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, saved the to 2 people from its bad consequences and there is no one among you today who has the qualities of Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) What happened to us when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died was that ‘Ali, az-Zubair and those who were with them stayed behind in the house of Fatimah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and all the Ansar stayed behind and gathered in Saqeefat Banu Sa`idah, whilst the Muhajireen gathered around Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) I said to him; O Abu Bakr, let us go to our brothers, the Ansar. So we set out, looking for them, then we were met by two righteous men who told us what the people had done, and said: where are you going, O Muhajireen? I said: We are looking for these brothers of ours, the Ansar, They said. You should not go near them; do whatever you have already decided, O Muhajireen. I said: By Allah, we will go to them. So we carried on until we came to them in Saqeefat Banu Sa`idah, where we found them gathered and among them was a man wrapped up [in a garment. I said: Who is this? They said: Sa`d bin `Ubadah. ! said: What is the matter with him? They said: He is sick. After we sat down, their spokesman stood up and praised and glorified Allah, may He glorified and exalted, as He deserves, then he said: To proceed. We are the supporters (Ansar) of Allah and the majority of the Muslim army. You, O Muhajireen, are a small group among us. Some of you came to us, wanting to deny who we are and prevent us from attaining a position of authority. When he fell silent, I wanted to present a speech that I had prepared and that I liked in front of Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) I used to avoid provoking him and he was more forbearing and more dignified than me. But Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) said: Wait a while. I did not like to make him angry, and he was more knowledgeable and more dignified than me. By Allah, he did not omit any word that I liked in the speech I had prepared but he said something like it or better, speaking spontaneously, until he finished speaking. Then he said: To proceed. Whatever you have mentioned about your achievements and virtues, is correct. The Arabs would not acknowledge the leadership of anyone except someone from this tribe of Quraish, for they are the best of the Arabs in lineage and location. I am pleased to suggest to you one of these two men, whichever of them you want. Then he took hold of my hand and the hand of Abu `Ubaidah bin al-Jarrah, and I disliked nothing of what he had said apart from this, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck struck for no sin on my part than to become the leader of people among whom was Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) unless my own self suggested something at the time of death. One of the Ansar said: I am the post on which the camel with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree [i.e., a noble]. [I suggest] a ruler from among us and a ruler from among you, O Quraish. - I the narrator said to Malik; What does ‘I am the post on which the cainc! with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree` mean? He said:It is as if he is saying, I am the smart one who has the answer. - Then there was a great deal of clamour and raised voices, to such an extent that I feared there would be a conflict, so I said: Hold out your hand, O Abu Bakr. So he held out his hand and I swore allegiance to him, and the Muhajireen swore allegiance to him, then the Ansar swore allegiance to him. Thus we surrounded Sa`d bin ‘Ubadah. One of them said: You have killed Sa`d i said: May Allah kill Sa’d! And `Umar (رضي الله عنه) said: By Allah, we never encountered any problem greater than the swearing of allegiance to Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) . We were afraid that if we left the people without having sworn allegiance to anyone, they might swear allegiance after we were gone, so we would either follow in their footsteps and swear allegiance to someone we were not pleased with, or we would disagree with them and that would cause trouble. If anyone swears allegiance to a leader without consulting the Muslims, there is no allegiance for him and no allegiance to the one who swore allegiance to him, lest both of them be killed. Malik said: Ibn Shihab told me, from `Urwah bin az-Zubair, that the men whom they met were `Uwaim bin Sa`idah and Ma`n bin `Adiyy. Ibn Shihab said. Sa`eed bin al-Musayyab told me that the one who said, I am the post on which the camel with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree, was al-lubab bin al-Mundhir.";Musnad Ahmad 391, Book 3, Hadith 1;question #3;What was the significance of the verse of stoning in the context of this narration?

What made you do that? `Uthman (رضي الله عنه)said: Sometimes many soorahs would be revealed (incomplete) to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) , and when something was revealed he would call one of the scribes to write it down for him and say: “Put this in the Soorah in which such and such is mentioned`; and verses would be revealed to him and he would say, `Put these verses in the soorah in which such and such is mentioned”; and a verse would be revealed to him and he would say: `Put this verse in the soorah in which such and such is mentioned.” Al-Anfal was one of the first soorahs to be revealed in Madinah and Bara`ah was one of the last soorahs of the Qur`an, and the stories and content of the two soorahs were similar. 
Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  passed away without having stated clearly to us that it was part of it, but we thought that it was, hence I put them together and I did not put between them the line Bismillahir-Rahmanir-Raheem.

"`Abdullah bin Shaddad came and entered upon `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) when we were sitting with her, as he was returning from Iraq during the time when ‘Ali           (رضي الله عنه) was murdered. She said to him: O `Abdullah bin Shaddad, will you tell me the truth about what I am going to ask you? Tell me about these people whom ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) killed. He said: Why shouldn`t I tell you the truth? She said: Tell me about them. He said: When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) corresponded with Mu`awiyah and the two arbitrators gave their verdict, eight thousand of the pious rebelled against him and camped in a land called Haroora`, near Koofah. They criticised him and said: You have taken off a chemise that Allah caused you to wear and a title that Allah gave to you, then you went ahead and asked people to issue a decree concerning the religion of Allah. There is no ruling except the ruling of Allah, may He be exalted. When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) heard about their criticism of him and the reason why they had split from him, he told his caller not to admit anyone but those who had memorised the Qur`an. When the house was filled with people who had memorised the Qur`an, he called for a large Mushaf and put it front of him, and he started tapping it with his hand, saying: O Mushaf, tell the people. The people called out: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, how could you ask it? It is only ink and paper, but we could speak on the basis of what we understand from it. What do you want? He said: These companions of yours who rebelled, between me and them is the Book of Allah, and Allah says in His Book concerning a woman and a man: `If you fear a breach between them twain (the man and his wife), appoint (two) arbitrators, one from his family and the other from hers; if they both wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation.` [an-Nisa 4:35]. The ummah of Muhammad is more important with regard to life and sanctity than a woman and a man. They got angry with me when I wrote a document between me and Mu`awiyah and wrote `Ali bin Abi Talib [without adding the title Ameer al-Mu`mineen]. But Suhail bin `Amr came to us when we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at al-Hudaibiyah, when he made a peace deal with Quraish, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote, `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.` Suhail said: Do not write, In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He said: What should we write? He said: Write: `In Your Name, O Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Write `Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).` He [Suhail] said: If I knew that you were the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I would not have opposed you. So he wrote: This is what was agreed by Muhammad bin `Abdullah with Quraish. And Allah says in His Book: “Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day` [Al-Ahzab 33:21]. So `Ali sent `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه) to them and I went out with him until we reached the middle of their camp. Ibnul-Kawwa` stood up and addressed the people, saying: O bearers of the Qur`an, this is `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه). Whoever does not know him, I know of the Book of Allah what can tell you about him, He is one of those concerning whom the words `they are a quarrelsome people` [Az-Zukhruf 43:58] were revealed. Tell him to go back to the one who sent him and do not discuss the Book of Allah with him. Their spokesmen stood up and said: By Allah, we will discuss the Book of Allah. If he says something sound and true that we recognise we will follow him, and if he says something false we will reject his false argument. So they discussed the Book with ‘Abdullah for three days, and four thousand of them recanted and all of them repented, including Ibnul-Kawwa`. He took them to `Ali in Koofah, and `Ali sent word to the rest of them, saying: You know the turmoil between us and our opponents. Stay wherever you wish until the ummah of Muhammad (ﷺ) is united. The deal between us and you is that you should not shed any blood that it is forbidden to shed or commit acts of banditry on the roads or do wrong to any Non Muslim under Muslim protection. If you do that, we will declare war, for Allah does not love those who betray. `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) said: O Ibn Shaddad, did he kill them? He said: By Allah, no sooner had he sent this message to them but they committed acts of banditry, shed blood and regarded it as permissible to harm Ahludh-Dhimmah (non-Muslims living under Muslim protection). She said: Do you swear by Allah? He said: I swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other god that this is what happened. She said: I have heard that the people of Iraq are talking and saying dhuth-thuda, dhuth-thuda [i.e., the one with a deformed arm that looks like a breast]. He said: I saw him and I was with ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) when he was examining the slain. He called the people and said: Do you know this one? How many of them came and said: I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so, and I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so. And there was no proof of who he was except that. She said: What did `Ali say when he stood over him, as the people of Iraq claim? He said: I heard him say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. She said: Did you hear him say anything other than that? He said: No, by Allah. She said: Yes, Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. May Allah have mercy on `Ali (رضي الله عنه): it was his habit, if he saw something he liked, to say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. But the people of Iraq fabricated lies against him and added words to what he said.";Musnad Ahmad 656, Book 5, Hadith 92;question #3;What role did the Qur'an play in the discussions between Ali (رضي الله عنه) and the rebels?

We got there before the mushrikeen and we found two of their men, a man from Quraish and a freed slave of “Uqbah bin Abi Mu`ait.

O people, put the blame on me and say: `Utbah bin Rabee`ah is a coward, although you know that I am not the most cowardly among you. Abu Jahl heard that and said: Are you saying this? By Allah, if anyone else said this I would have insulted him; you are filled with fear, ‘Utbah said: Do you mean me, O you with the whistling rear end (i.e., one who breaks wind a great deal because of fear)? Today you will know which of us is the coward. Then ‘Utbah and his brother Shaibah and his son al-Waleed stepped forward in a display of courage and said: Who will come out to fight in single combat? Six young men of the Ansar stepped forward, but `Utbah said: We do not want these; let some of our cousins of Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib come out.

I have heard that he has been killed; shroud him with them.” We brought the two pieces of cloth to shroud Hamzah with them, but we saw beside him one of the Ansar who had been killed, and the same had been done to him as to Hamzah. We did not feel it was appropriate to shroud Hamzah in two pieces of cloth and to leave the Ansari with no shroud, so we said: “One piece for Hamzah and one piece for the Ansari.” We measured (the pieces of cloth) and found that one of them was larger, so we drew lots between them and shrouded each of them in the piece of cloth that was selected for him.";Musnad Ahmad 1418, Book 7, Hadith 14;question #3;What was the reaction of Safiyyah when she was stopped from seeing the slain at the Battle of Uhud?

Before that, the Prophet (ﷺ) had suggested to az-Zubair (رضي الله عنه) something that would be good for both him and the Ansari, but when the Ansari annoyed the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he told az-Zubair to take his rights in full in a clear ruling. `Urwah said: “az-Zubair (رضي الله عنه) said: By Allah, I think that this verse was revealed concerning that: But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad (ﷺ)) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission` (an-Nisa` [4:65]).”;Musnad Ahmad 1419, Book 7, Hadith 15;question #3;What does this incident teach about the importance of fairness and justice in resolving conflicts?

I said: Drink, O Messenger of Allah. He drank until I was pleased, then I said: Is it time to move on? So we moved on and the people were coming after us but none of them caught up with us except Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju'shum, who was riding a horse of his, I said: O Messenger of Allah, someone has caught up with us. He said: `Do not be afraid, for Allah is with us.` When he got close to us, and there was no more between us and him then the length of a spear or two or three spears, I said: O Messenger of Allah, this pursuer has caught up with us, and I wept. He said: `Why are you weeping?` I said: I am not weeping for myself; rather I am weeping for you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed against him [the pursuer] and said: “O Allah, protect us from him by whatever means You will.” Then his horse's legs sank into the solid ground up to its belly, and he fell off it. He said: O Muhammad, I know that this is because of you; pray to Allah to save me from my predicament, and by Allah I shall divert away from you any one who is behind me of those who are seeking you. Here is my quiver, take one arrow. You are going to pass by some camels and sheep of mine in such and such a place, take whatever you need from thern.

They came out on the road and on the roofs, and a lot of servants and children crowded the road saying: Allahu Akbar, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has come, Muhammad has come.

Al-Bara' bin 'Azib said: The first of the Muhajireen to come to us was Mus'ab bin 'Umair, the brother of Banu 'Abdud-Dar. Then Ibn Umm Maktoom, the blind man and brother of Banu Fihr, came to us.

"One day the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got up and prayed Fajr, then he sat until the forenoon, then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled. Then he sat where he was until he had prayed Zuhr, 'Asr and Maghrib, and he did not speak until he had prayed 'isha'. Then he got up and went to his family. The people said to Abu Bakr: Why don't you ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) what is the matter? He did something today that he never did before. So he asked him and he said: `Yes, I was shown what is to come of this world and the Hereafter. The earlier and later generations were gathered in one place and the people got terrified because of that. They went to Adam when the sweat was about to reach their mouths, and they said: O Adam, you are the father of mankind and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose you. Intercede for us with your Lord, He said: I am in the same position as you. Go to your father after your father, to Nooh, “Allah chose Adam, Nooh (Noah), the family of Ibraheem (Abraham) and the family of 'Imran above the 'Alameen (mankind and jinn) (of their times)` (Al 'Imran 3:33}.

Then they will go to Nooh and will say: Intercede with your Lord for us, for Allah chose you and answered your supplication, and He did not leave one of the disbelievers on the Earth (cf. 71:26). He will say: I am not the one you want; go to Ibraheem for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, took him as a close friend (khaleel). So they will go to Ibraheem but he will say: I am not the one you want; go to Moosa, for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, spoke directly to him (cf. 4:164). But Moosa will say: I am not the one you want; go to 'Eesa Ibn Maryam, for he healed those born blind and the lepers, and he brought forth the dead. But 'Eesa will say: I am not the one you want; go to the leader of the sons of Adam, for he is the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection. Go to Muhammad, for he will intercede for you with your Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. Then (the Prophet) will go and Jibreel will come to his Lord and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Give him permission and give him the glad tidings of Paradise. Jibreel will take him and he will fall down in prostration for a week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intercession will be accepted. So he will raise his head, and when he looks at his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, he will fall down in prostration for another week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intersession will be accepted. He will start to fall down in prostration again, but Jibreel (peace be upon him) will take hold of his upper arms and Allah, may he be glorified and exalted, will inspire him to offer a supplication such as no human being was ever inspired with. He will say: `O Lord, You created me as the leader of the sons of Adam, and no boast; the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection, and no boast; there will come to my Cistern more people than there can be between San‘a’ and Allah (Eilat).` Then it will be said: Call the Siddeeq's so that they might intercede. Then it will be said: Call the Prophets. So one Prophet will come with a group, and another Prophet will come with five or six people, and another Prophet will come with nobody. Then it will be said: Call the martyrs so that they might intercede for whoever they want. When the martyrs do that, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: I am the Most Merciful of those who show mercy; I admit to My Paradise anyone who does not associate anything with Me.

So they will enter Paradise. Then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look in Hell; can you find anyone who ever did anything good? And they will find a man in Hell, and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that I was easy-going with people in buying and selling. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Be easy-going with My slave as he was easygoing with My slaves.

"These are the types of charity (zakah) that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made obligatory upon the Muslims and which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, enjoined upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Whoever among the Muslims is asked to pay it in the proper manner, let him give it; whoever is asked for more than that, let him not give it. For less than twenty-five camels, for each five, one sheep (should be given). If the number reaches twenty-five, then one she-camel in its second year (should be given), up to thirty-five. If there is no she-camel in its second year, then a he-camel in its third year (may be given). If the number reaches thirty-six, then a she-camel in its third year (should be given), up to forty-five. If the number reaches forty-six, then a she-camel in its fourth year that has been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to sixty, If the number reaches sixty-one, then a she-camel in its fifth year (should be given), up to seventy five. If the number reaches seventy-six, then two she-camels in their second year (should be given), up to ninety. If the number reaches ninety-one, then two she camels in their fourth year that have been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to one hundred and twenty. If the number is more than one hundred and twenty, then for every forty camels, a she-camel limits third year should be given and for every fifty a she-camel in its fourth year. If the ages of the camels for zakah differ, if what is due is a she-camel in its fifth year but he does not own such a camel, but he has a she-camel in its fourth year, then that will be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, if available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she-camel in its fourth year and he only has a she camel in its fifth year, it should be accepted from him and the zakat collector should give him back twenty dirhams or two sheep. If what is due from him is a shecamel in its fourth year, but he does not have such a cameland he has a she-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, is available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she camel in its second year, but he only has a he-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and nothing should be added to it. If he has only four camels, no zakah is due unless the owner wants to give it. With regard to zakah on sheep in the pasture, if there are forty sheep, then one sheep is due as zakah, up to one hundred and twenty sheep. of there is one more than that, then two sheep are due, up to two hundred. If there is one more than that then three sheep are due, up to three hundred. If there is one more than that, then for every hundred sheep, one sheep is due No toothless or defective sheep should be taken as zakah and neither should a ram, unless the one who is giving allows that. Separate flocks should not be put together and flocks should not be divided so as to avoid or reduce zakah. If there are two partners [and the zakah-collector comes and takes zakah), they should settle the matter between them on a fair basis. If a man's flock is grazing if it is one less than forty, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it. On silver the zakah is one quarter of one tenth; if the wealth is only one hundred and ninety dirhams, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it.";Musnad Ahmad 72, Book 1, Hadith 68;question #4;What is the zakah requirement for sheep and how does it change with the number of sheep owned?
"The people of Makkah say: Ibn Juraij learned the prayer from 'Ata' and `Ata` learned it from Ibn az-Zubair and Ibn az-Zubair learned it from Abu Bakr and Abu Bakr learned it from the Prophet (ﷺ). I have never seen anyone who prays better than Ibn Juraij.

He said: Nothing prevented me from giving you an answer when you offered her to me in marriage except that I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) mention her and I did not want to disclose the private matters of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). If he had not married her, I would have married her.;Musnad Ahmad 74, Book 1, Hadith 70;question #4;How did the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) approach marriage proposals?

‘Umar has come to me and told me that casualties were heavy at al-Yamamah among the Muslims who knew the Qur'an by heart, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Muslims who know the Qur'an by heart on other battlefields and a large part of the Qur’an may be lost. I ['Umar] think that you [Abu Bakr should issue instructions that the Qur'an be collected. I said to ‘Umar. How can I do anything that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not do? He said: By Allah, it is a good thing. And he kept urging me to do that until Allah opened my heart to it and I came around to 'Umar's point of view.

I know what you are going to say. You are going to say: He (the Prophet (ﷺ)) is the son of my brother and I should have half of the wealth. And I know what you are going to say, O 'Ali. You are going to say: His daughter is married to me and she should have half of the wealth. This is what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had, and we saw how he managed it. Then Abu Bakr took charge of it after him, and he dealt with it in the same way as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had dealt with it. Then I took charge after Abu Bakr and I swear by Allah that I will strive my best to deal with it as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr to dealt with it. Then he said: Abu Bakr told me and he swore by Allah that he was telling the truth, that he heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say: `The Prophet is not to be inherited from; rather his estate is to go to the poor and needy Muslims.` And Abu Bakr told me and swore by Allah that he was telling the truth, that the Prophet (ﷺ) Said: 'No Prophet dies until he has been led in prayer by one of his ummah.` This is what was in the possession of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and we saw how he dealt with it. If you wish, I will give it to you to manage it in the same way as the Messenger of Al!ah (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr did, so that I can put it under your control.

The people gathered and he ascended the minbar, which was something that was made for him to deliver speeches, and it was the first speech he gave in Islam. He praised and glorified Allah, then he said: O People, I wish that someone else could have taken care of this for me, for if you compare my way to the way of your Prophet (ﷺ), I cannot be like him, for he was protected from the shaitan and the revelation used to come to him from heaven.;Musnad Ahmad 80, Book 1, Hadith 76;question #4;What was the purpose of the minbar that was made for Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq?
Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded me to say, in the morning, in the evening and when I went to bed at night: `O Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth.

"I saw a dream that I can only interpret as meaning that my death is near; I saw as if a rooster pecked me twice, and I was told that it was a red rooster. I told this dream to Asma’ bint 'Umais, the wife of Abu Bakr , and she said: You will be killed by a Persian man. The people are asking me to appoint a successor, but Allah will not cause His religion and His caliphate, with which He sent His Prophet ﷺ to be lost. If death comes to me soon, then the caliphate is to be decided by these six men with whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was pleased when he died. Whichever of them you swear allegiance to, then listen to him and obey. I know that some people will object to this matter. I have fought them with my own hands in the defence of Islam. 
They are the enemies of Allah and misguided kafirs. By Allah, I am not leaving behind anything that my Lord instructed me to do and I came to the position of caliphate on that basis that is more important to me than kalalah. By Allah, the Prophet of Allah ﷺ never emphasised any issue to me since I accompanied him more than the issue of kalalah, until he poked me in the chest with his finger and said: `Is not ayatas-saif (the verse of summer, i.e., it was revealed in summer), which appears at the end of Sooratan Nisa', sufficient for you?` If I live I will issue a decree that will be so clear that those who read the Qur'an and those who do not read it will be able to make decisions concerning it. I call upon Allah to bear witness over the governors of the regions, for I only sent them to be just and to teach the people their religion and the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ and to refer to me concerning any difficult matter. O people, you eat two plants which I find to be nothing but repugnant, this onion and garlic. I remember the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, if he noticed their smell coming from a man in the mosque, he would issue orders that he taken out from the mosque to al-Baqee'.

They have attacked 'Abdullah bin ‘Umar and dislocated his arms, as you heard about their attack on the Ansari before him.

I want my work to be an act of charity towards the Muslims. 'Umar said: Do not do that, for I wanted to do the same as you want to do. The Prophet ﷺ would give me some payment and I would say: Give it to one who is more in need of it than me. One day he gave me something and I said: Give it to one who is more in need of it than me.

He said: “Nor is it the word of a soothsayer (or a foreteller), little is that you remember! This is the Revelation sent down from the Lord of the 'Alameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists). And if he (Muhammad ﷺ) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah).

O Allah, accomplish for me what You have promised me! O Allah, if this small band of Muslims is destroyed, You will never be worshipped on earth.” He kept beseeching his Lord, calling out to Him, until his upper garment fell from his shoulders. Abu Bakr came to him, picked up his upper garment and put it on him. Then he embraced him from behind and said: O Prophet of Allah, this prayer of yours to your Lord will suffice, for He will accomplish for you what He has promised to you. Then Allah revealed the words: `(Remember) when you sought help of your Lord and He answered you (saying): ‘I will help you with a thousand of the angels each behind the other (following one another) in succession` [al Anfal 8:9). On that day when the armies met (in battle), Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, defeated the mushrikeen; seventy of their men were killed and seventy were taken captive. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) consulted Abu Bakr, 'Ali and 'Umar رضي الله عنهم (concerning the prisoners). Abu Bakr said: O Prophet of Allah, they are our cousins, kinsmen and brothers, I think that you should accept a ransom for them, which will strengthen us against the kuffar, and perhaps Allah will guide them to Islam and they will become a support to us. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: “What do you think, O son of al-Khattab?` I said: No, by Allah. I do not think as Abu Bakr thinks. I think that you should hand. So and so ­ a relative of ʼUmar's- ­ over 
to me so that I may strike his neck. You should hand ‘Aqeel over to ‘Ali so that he may strike his neck, and you should hand over So and so to Hamzah (his brother) so that he may strike his neck, so that Allah will know that we have no mercy in our hearts towards the mushrikeen; these are 
their prominent figures and leaders. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  inclined towards the view of Abu Bakr, and he did not incline towards what I said, and accepted ransoms from them. The next day, I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and found him with Abu Bakr, and they were both weeping I said: O Messenger of Allah , tell me why you and your companion are weeping. If I find it is a cause for weeping, I will weep too, and is it is not, then I will make myself weep with you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `I am weeping because of what your companions suggested about accepting a ransom for the prisoners. I have been shown your punishment as close as this tree` ­ a tree that was close to the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) Then Allah revealed the words:`It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land. You desire the good of this world (i.e. the money of ransom for freeing the captives), but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter. And Allah is Almighty, All Wise. Were it not a previous ordainment from Allah, a severe torment would have touched you for what you took `[al Anfal 8:67­-68] ­ i.e., referring to the ransom.

On the day of Badr, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) looked at his companions and they were three hundred and some, then he looked at the mushrikeen and saw that they were one thousand or more. The Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) turned to face the qiblah, then he stretched forth his hands, wearing his upper and lower garment, and he said: “O Allah, where is Your promise to me? O Allah, accomplish for me what You have promised me! O Allah, if this small band of Muslims is destroyed, You will never be worshiped on earth.” He kept beseeching his Lord, calling out to Him, until his upper garment fell from his shoulders. Abu Bakr came to him, picked up his upper garment and put it back on him. Then he embraced him from behind and said, “O Prophet of Allah, this prayer of yours to your Lord will suffice, for He will accomplish for you what He has promised to you.” Then Allah revealed the words: “(Remember) when you sought help of your Lord and He answered you (saying): ‘I will help you with a thousand of the angels each behind the other (following one another) in succession’” (al-Anfal 8:9). On that day when the armies met (in battle), Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, caused the mushrikeen to be defeated, seventy of their men were killed and seventy were taken captive. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) consulted Abu Bakr, ‘Ali and ʼUmar (concerning the prisoners). Abu Bakr said, “O Prophet of Allah, they are our cousins, kinsmen and brothers. I think that you should accept a ransom for them, which will strengthen us against the kuffar, and perhaps Allah will guide them to Islam and they will become a support to us.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, “What do you think, O son of al-Khattab?” I said: No, by Allah. I do not think as Abu Bakr thinks. I think that you should hand so and so—a relative of ‘Umar's—to me so that I may strike his neck, You should hand ‘Aqeel over to ‘Ali so that he may strike his neck, and you should hand over so and so to Hamzah (his brother) so that he may strike his neck, so that Allah will know that we have no mercy in our hearts towards the mushrikeen; these are their prominent figures and leaders. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) inclined towards the view of Abu Bakr, and he did not incline towards what I said, and accepted ransoms from them. The next day. I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and found him with Abu Bakr, and they were both weeping. I said, “O Messenger of Allah, tell me why you and your companion are weeping. If I find it is a cause for weeping. I will weep too, and if it is not, then I will make myself weep with you.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, “I am weeping because of what your companions suggested about accepting a ransom for the prisoners. I have been shown your punishment as close as this tree”—a tree that was close to the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ). Then Allah revealed the words: “It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land. You desire the good of this world (i.e. the money of ransom for freeing the captives), but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter, And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. Were it not a previous ordainment from Allah, a severe torment would have touched you for what you took.” [al-Anfal 8:67-68] i.e., referring to the ransom. Then booty was permitted to them, and when the day of Uhud came the following year, they were punished for what they had done for taking the ransom on the day of Badr. Seventy of them were killed and the Companions of the Prophet deserted him; his front tooth was broken and the helmet on his head was broken, and blood flowed down his face, and Allah revealed the words: “When a single disaster smites you, although you smote (your enemies) with one twice as great, you say: ‘From where does this come to us?’ Say (to them), ‘It is from yourselves (because of your evil deeds).’ And Allah has power over all things” [Al ‘Imran 3:165];Musnad Ahmad 221, Book 2, Hadith 138;question #4;What was the outcome of the Prophet Muhammad's (ﷺ) prayer during the Battle of Badr?
"I was eager to ask 'Umar about the two wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) concerning whom Allah said, “If you two (wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) turn in repentance
to Allah, (it will be better for you), your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet (ﷺ) likes)” [at-Tahreem 66:4], until 'Umar went for Hajj and I went with him. When we were partway there, 'Umar turned aside and I turned aside with him, bringing the jug. He relieved himself, then he came to me and I poured water onto his hands, and he did wudoo’. I said: “O Ameer al -Mu'mineen, who are the two wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) of whom Allah said: ‘If you two (wives of the Prophet (ﷺ)) turn in repentance to Allah, (it will be better for you), your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet (ﷺ) likes)’?” [at-Tahreem 66:4] 'Umar said, “How strange of you, O Ibn  'Abbas”, (az-Zuhri said: By Allah, he did not like the question, but he did not conceal anything.) He said, “They were Hafsah and 'A'ishah.” Then he started to narrate the hadeeth and said: We people of Quraish were a people who dominated women, but when we came to Madinah we found a people who were dominated by their women, and our women started to learn from their women. My house was among Banu Umayyah bin Zaid in al-'Awali. One day I got angry with my wife, and she argued with me. I did not like her to argue with me, but she said: Do you not like me to argue with you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) argue with him, and one of them will forsake him all day until night comes, I went and entered upon Hafsah, and I said: Do
you argue with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? She said: Yes. I said: Does one of you forsake him all day until night comes? She said: Yes. I said: Any one of you who does that is doomed and lost. Does any one of you feel assured that Allah will not be angry with her because of the anger of His
Messenger (ﷺ), for then she will be doomed? Do not argue with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and do not ask him for anything. Ask me for whatever you want. And do not be misled by the fact that your neighbour is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) than
you – referring to 'A'ishah. And ‘Umar said: I had a neighbour among the Ansar. We used to take turns to go down to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He would go down one day and I would go down the next. He would bring me the news of the Revelation and other things, and I would do likewise.
We were saying that Ghassan were shoeing their horses to attack us. My friend went down, then he came to me at night and knocked on my door, then he called out to me. I went out to him and he said: Something terrible has happened! I said: What? Have Ghassan come? He said: No, it is more terrible than that and worse. The Prophet (ﷺ) has divorced his wives! I said: Hafsah is doomed and lost! I thought that this would happen. Then when I had prayed Fajr, I got dressed, then I went down and entered upon Hafsah, who was weeping. I said: Has the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)divorced you? She said: I do not know. He has secluded himself in this loft. I went to a black slave of his and said: Ask for permission for ‘Umar to enter. He went in, then he came out to me and said: I mentioned you to him but he did not say anything, I went away and came to the minbar, where I sat down. By it was a group of people, some of whom were weeping. I sat for a little while, then I could not bear it any longer, so I went to the slave and said: Ask for permission for ‘Umar to enter. He went in, then he came out to me and said: I mentioned you to him but he did not say anything. I turned to leave, then the slave called me and said: Go in, he has given you permission. So I went in and greeted the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with salam. He was resting on a reed mat that had left marks on his side. I said: O Messenger of Allah, have you divorced your wives? He looked up at me and said, “No.” I said: Allah Akbar! if you had seen us, O Messenger of Allah, we Quraish were a people who dominated women, but when we came to Madinah we found a people who were dominated by their women, and our women started to learn from their women. I got angry with my wife one day, and she started to argue with me. I did not like her to argue with me, but she said: Do you not like me to argue with you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) argue with him, and one of them will forsake him all day until night comes. I said: Any one of them who does that is doomed and lost. Does one of them feel assured that Allah will not be angry with her because of the anger of His Messenger (ﷺ),then she will be doomed? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled. I said: O Messenger of Allah, I entered upon Hafsah and I said: Do not be misled by the fact that your neighbour (i.e. ‘Aa'ishah) is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) than you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled again. I said: O Messenger of Allah, may I speak to you freely? He said: “Yes.” So I sat down and looked around the room, and by Allah, I did not see anything in it to please the eye except three hides. I said: Pray to Allah, O Messenger of Allah, to make life prosperous for your ummah, for He has made life prosperous for the Persians and Romans, but they do not worship Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. He sat up straight and said: “Are you doubting. O son of al-Khattab? They are people whose good things have been hastened for them in this world.” I said: Pray for forgiveness for me, O Messenger of Allah. He had sworn that he would not enter upon them for a month, because he was so annoyed with them until Allah rebuked him.";Musnad Ahmad 222, Book 2, Hadith 139;question #4;How did the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) respond to Umar's concerns about his wives?

I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when he was in al-Batha` and he said: `What did you enter ihram for?` I said: I have entered ihram for the same as the Prophet (ﷺ) did. He said: `Have you brought a sacrificial animal?` I said: No. He said: “Circumambulate the House and go between as-Safa and al-Marwah, then exit ihraam.” So I circumambulated the House and went between as-Safa and al-Marwah, then I went to a woman of my people and she combed my hair and washed my head.

`Umar said: Allah, may He be exalted, sent Muhammad (ﷺ) and sent down the Book to him. Among that which was revealed to him was the verse of stoning. We recited it and understood it. But I fear that with the passage of time, some people will say: We do not find the verse of stoning in the Book of Allah, and as a result an obligation that Allah revealed will be forsaken.

"‘Umar said to me: Haven`t I been told that you do certain tasks for the state, then when you are given payment you do not accept it? He said: Yes. He said: Why do you do that? He said: I am well off and I have slaves and horses; I want my work to be a charity to the Muslims. He said: Do not do that, for I used to do what you are doing, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would give me payment, and I would say: Give it someone who is more in need of it than me, And he said: Whatever of this wealth comes to you when you are not hoping for it or asking for it, take it, otherwise do not hanker after it.”It was narrated that as-Sa`ib bin Yazeed said: `Umar met `Abdullah bin as-Sa`di... and he mentioned a similar report, but he said: “Give it in charity,” and he said: “Do not hanker after it.`";Musnad Ahmad 279, 280, Book 2, Hadith 190;question #4;What is the Islamic perspective on refusing payment for services rendered?

ʼUmar was a man of protective jealousy, and when he went out to pray, `Atikah bint Zaid would follow him, although he did not like her going out, but he did not like to stop her. He used to narrate that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `if your womenfolk ask you for permission to pray in the mosque, do not prevent them.`;Musnad Ahmad 283, Book 2, Hadith 193;question #4;How does the concept of not preventing women from attending mosque prayers reflect on gender roles in Islam?

"I heard ‘Umar say: Do not make women`s dowries expensive, do not make women`s dowries expensive, for had this been a sign of honour in this world or piety before Allah, the first one of you to do it would have been the Prophet (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not give any of his wives, and none of his daughters were given, any more than twelve Oasiyyahs [as a dowry. And a man will go to great trouble in order to offer a high dowry to his wife.
On one occasion he said: A man would pay his wife a high dowry until he feels resentment towards her and says: You cost me everything I own, even the string to tie a waterskin and hang it up. He [the narrator] said: I was a young Arab boy with a non-Arab mother, and I did not know what a `string` was. `Umar said: And another thing you say of one who is killed in your campaigns and dies that so and so was killed as a martyr, and o and so died as a martyr. But perhaps he loaded the back of his mount with gold and silver for the purpose of trading. So do not say that, rather say what the Prophet (ﷺ) (or what Muhammad) (ﷺ) said: “Whoever is killed or dies for the sake of Allah will be in Paradise.`";Musnad Ahmad 285, Book 2, Hadith 195;question #4;How should one refer to individuals who die in campaigns according to Islamic teachings?
"`Umar bin al-Khattab gave a speech and said: O people, we used to know you when the Prophet (ﷺ) was among us and revelation was coming down to him; Allah would tell us about you. But now the Prophet (ﷺ) has passed away and revelation has ceased, and now the way to judge you is this whoever among you shows us good conduct, we will think well of him and love him; whoever among you shows us bad conduct, we will think badly of him and hate him for that, and whatever is in your hearts is between you and your Lord. There was a time when I used to think that whoever learned the Qur`an, seeking thereby Allah and (the reward that) is with Him, would be rewarded in the Hereafter, but some men learned Qur`an seeking that which is with people. So seek Allah by learning Qur`an and by your good deeds. By Allah, I do not send my workers to strike you or seize your wealth; rather I send them to you to teach you your religion and Sunnah, whoever has done to him something other than that, let him refer it to me, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, I shall surely grant him retaliation. `Amr bin al-`As stood up and said: O Ameer al Mu`mineen, do you think if one of the Muslims was in charge of some people and he disciplined one of them, would you allow that one to settle the score with him? He said: Yes, by the One in Whose hand is the soul of `Umar, I would not certainly allow him to settle the score with him. I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) do that with regard to himself. But do not strike the Muslims and thus humiliate them, and do not keep them away from their wives on campaign for too long and thus expose them to temptation. Do not withhold from them their due rights and cause them to rebel; and do not make them camp in an area with a lot of trees, because that will cause them to be scattered.It was narrated that ‘Abul-`Ajfa` as-Sulami said: I heard ‘Umar say: Do not make women`s dowries expensive,... and he mentioned the same hadeeth.";Musnad Ahmad 286, 287, Book 2, Hadith 196;question #4;What responsibilities do leaders have towards their people according to the teachings of `Umar bin al-Khattab?
"I was sitting beside Ibn ‘Umar, and we were waiting for the funeral of Umm Aban bint `Uthman bin `Affan. `Amr bin `Uthman was also present. Ibn ‘Abbas came, led by a guide, who told him where Ibn ‘Umar was. He came and sat beside me, so I was between them, and we heard a voice from inside the house, Ibn `Umar said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: `The deceased is tormented because of the crying of his family.` He said: And `Abdullah understood it as general in meaning. Ibn `Abbas said: We were with Ameer al-Muʼmineen ‘Umar until we came to some arid land, where we found a man who had halted in the shade of a tree. He said to me: Go and find out for me who that man is, I went and found that it was Suhaib. I came back to him and said: You told me to find out for you who that man is; it is Suhaib. He said: Tell him to join us. I said: He has his family with him. He said: Even if he has his family with him [and perhaps Ayyoob said on one occasion:Tell him to join us). When we came to Madinah, it was not long before Ameer al Muʼmineen [ʼUmar} was attacked. Suhaib came, saying O my brother, O my friend! `Umar said: Do you not know, or have you not heard, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `The deceased is tormented because of some of his family`s crying.” “Abdullah understood it as general in meaning, but ‘Umar said: some of [their] weeping. I went to `A`ishah, and I told her what Ibn `Umar had said. She said: No, by Allah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not say, “The deceased is tormented because of the weeping of anyone.” Rather he said: “Allah increases the torment of the kafir because of his family`s weeping, and that it is He (Allah) Who makes (whom He wills) laugh, and makes (whom He wills) weep, “And no bearer of burdens shall bear another`s burden` [Al Anʼam 6:164].” Ayyoob said: Ibn Abu Mulaikah said: al-Qasim bin Muhammad told me: When `Aʼishah heard what ʼUmar and Ibn `Umar had said, she said. You are narrating to me from two who are not liars and are not to be suspected of being liars, but one may mishear.`Abdullah bin Abi Mulaikah narrated… and he mentioned a hadeeth similar to that of Ayyoob, except that he said: ibn `Umar said to `Amr bin `Uthman, when he was facing him: Why don`t you tell them not to weep? For the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `The deceased is tormented because of his family`s weeping for him.`";Musnad Ahmad 288, 289, Book 2, Hadith 197;question #4;How do different companions of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) interpret the same hadith differently?
A daughter of `Uthman bin `Affan died in Makkah and Ibn `Umar and Ibn `Abbas attended her funeral. I was sitting between them and ibn `Umar said to ‘Amr bin `Uthman, who was facing him: why don`t you tell them not to weep? For I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: `The deceased is tormented because of his family`s weeping for him.` And he mentioned a hadeeth similar to that of Isma`eel from Ayyoob from Ibn Abu Mulaikah.;Musnad Ahmad 290, Book 2, Hadith 198;question #4;What role do companions like Ibn `Umar and Ibn `Abbas play in preserving and conveying hadiths?

"`Umar would swear an oath three times, saying: By Allah, no one has more right to this wealth than anyone else, I have no more right to it than anyone else; there is no Muslim who does not have a share in this wealth, except a slave, but it is to be divided according to our categories in the light of the Book of Allah and our closeness to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Thus it is to be given on the basis of a man`s efforts for the sake of lslam, his seniority in Islam, his support for Islam, and his need. By Allah, if I live, a shepherd in the mountains of San‘a’ will get his share of that wealth when he is tending his flock.";Musnad Ahmad 292, Book 2, Hadith 200;question #4;How does proximity to the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) affect one's share in wealth distribution?

If you had said anything else I would not have believed you. The people wept for him when they heard that, but he said: Do not weep for us; whoever wants to weep, let him leave. Did you not hear what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said?

l heard `Umar bin al Khattab say: The people of Jahiliyyah used not to move on from Jam` until they saw the sun shining on (the mountain of) Thabeer, and they would say: Shine Thabeer, then we will move on swiftly.

I was about to interrupt him whilst he was praying, but I waited until he finished his prayer, and then I tied his garment around his neck. I said to him: Who taught you this soorah that you are reciting? He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) taught it to me. I said to him: You are lying by Allah! He taught me this soorah that you recited. I brought him to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said, `O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I heard this man reciting Sooratal-Furqan in a way different to the way you taught it to me, and you taught me Sooratal-Furqan, The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Let him go, O `Umar: Recite it, O Hisham. So he recited it to him as I had heard him recite it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, `Thus it was revealed.` Then he said to me, `Recite it,” so I recited it and he said, “Thus it was revealed.` Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is said: `This Qur`an has been revealed in seven different ways, so recite it in the way that is easiest for you.”It was narrated from al Miswar bin Makhramah and `Abdur-Rahman bin Abdul-Qari that  they heard Umar bin al Khattab say: I passed by Hisham bin Hakeem bin Hizam when he was reciting Sooratal-Furqan during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).

"I used to recite to ‘AbdurRahman bin ‘Awf, and he found me waiting for him. That was in Mina during the last Hajj performed by `Umar bin al-Khattab (رضي الله عنه) Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf said: A man came to `Umar bin al-Khattab and said: So and so is saying: If `Umar (رضي الله عنه) dies, I will swear allegiance to So and so. ʼUmar (رضي الله عنه) said: I will stand before the people today and warn them against these people who want to deprive them of their rights, `Abdur-Rahman said: I said: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, do not do that, for the Hajj season brings together the riffraff and rabble among the people, and most of the people who gather around and listen to you will be of that type. Is you stand before the people, I am afraid that you will say something that they will spread and not understand it properly or interpret it properly. Rather wait until you come to Madinah, for it is the land of Hijrah and the Sunnah, and you will meet the most knowledgeable and noble people there, and you can say what you want to say with confidence; they wilt understand what you say and will interpret it correctly, `Umar (رضي الله عنه) said: If I reach Madinah safe and sound, I shall certainly talk to the people there in the first speech I deliver. When we came to Madinah at the end of Dhul-I-Iijah, it was a Friday. I set out early, ‘Umar did not care at what time he went out, because he did not pay attention to heat and cold and so on. I found Sa`eed bin Zaid at the right-hand corner of the minbar, he had got there before me. I sat down next to him, with my knee touching his knee, and it was not long before `Umar (رضي الله عنه)came. When I saw him, I said: He will certainly speak today on this minbar and say something that no one ever heard before. Sa`eed bin Zaid objected to that and said: What do you think he will say that no one said before? `Umar (رضي الله عنه)sat on the minbar, and when the mu`dhdhin fell silent, he stood up and praised and glorified Allah as He deserves, then he said: To proceed o people, I am going to tell you something that it has been decreed I should say. I do not know, perhaps it may signal my death. So whoever understands it and remembers it, let him narrate it to others wherever his mount takes him; whoever does not understand il, it is not permissible for him to tell lies about me. Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, sent Muhammad (ﷺ) with the truth and revealed the Book to him; among the things that were revealed to him was the verse of stoning [adulterers). We read it and understood it; the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stoned [adulterers] and we stoned adulterers] after him. But I fear that with the passage of time, some people will say: We do not find the verse of stoning in the Book of Allah, thus they will go astray by forsaking an  obligation that Allah revealed. Stoning is the due punishment in the Book of Allah for those who commit zina, both men and women, if they have been married and if proof is established, or there is a pregnancy or a confession, And we used to recite: Do not claim to be the offspring of anyone other than your fathers, as it is disbelief (or ingratitude) on your part to claim to be the offspring of anyone other than your fathers, Verily the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Do not praise me excessively as `Eesa, the son of Maryam, was praised; rather I am the slave of Allah, so say, the slave of Allah and His Messenger.` I have heard that some among you are saying. If `Umar (رضي الله عنه) dies, I shall swear allegiance to So and so. No man should deceive himself by saying that the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was is successful. There is no doubt that this is the case, but Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, saved the to 2 people from its bad consequences and there is no one among you today who has the qualities of Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) What happened to us when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died was that ‘Ali, az-Zubair and those who were with them stayed behind in the house of Fatimah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and all the Ansar stayed behind and gathered in Saqeefat Banu Sa`idah, whilst the Muhajireen gathered around Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) I said to him; O Abu Bakr, let us go to our brothers, the Ansar. So we set out, looking for them, then we were met by two righteous men who told us what the people had done, and said: where are you going, O Muhajireen? I said: We are looking for these brothers of ours, the Ansar, They said. You should not go near them; do whatever you have already decided, O Muhajireen. I said: By Allah, we will go to them. So we carried on until we came to them in Saqeefat Banu Sa`idah, where we found them gathered and among them was a man wrapped up [in a garment. I said: Who is this? They said: Sa`d bin `Ubadah. ! said: What is the matter with him? They said: He is sick. After we sat down, their spokesman stood up and praised and glorified Allah, may He glorified and exalted, as He deserves, then he said: To proceed. We are the supporters (Ansar) of Allah and the majority of the Muslim army. You, O Muhajireen, are a small group among us. Some of you came to us, wanting to deny who we are and prevent us from attaining a position of authority. When he fell silent, I wanted to present a speech that I had prepared and that I liked in front of Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) I used to avoid provoking him and he was more forbearing and more dignified than me. But Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) said: Wait a while. I did not like to make him angry, and he was more knowledgeable and more dignified than me. By Allah, he did not omit any word that I liked in the speech I had prepared but he said something like it or better, speaking spontaneously, until he finished speaking. Then he said: To proceed. Whatever you have mentioned about your achievements and virtues, is correct. The Arabs would not acknowledge the leadership of anyone except someone from this tribe of Quraish, for they are the best of the Arabs in lineage and location. I am pleased to suggest to you one of these two men, whichever of them you want. Then he took hold of my hand and the hand of Abu `Ubaidah bin al-Jarrah, and I disliked nothing of what he had said apart from this, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck struck for no sin on my part than to become the leader of people among whom was Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) unless my own self suggested something at the time of death. One of the Ansar said: I am the post on which the camel with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree [i.e., a noble]. [I suggest] a ruler from among us and a ruler from among you, O Quraish. - I the narrator said to Malik; What does ‘I am the post on which the cainc! with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree` mean? He said:It is as if he is saying, I am the smart one who has the answer. - Then there was a great deal of clamour and raised voices, to such an extent that I feared there would be a conflict, so I said: Hold out your hand, O Abu Bakr. So he held out his hand and I swore allegiance to him, and the Muhajireen swore allegiance to him, then the Ansar swore allegiance to him. Thus we surrounded Sa`d bin ‘Ubadah. One of them said: You have killed Sa`d i said: May Allah kill Sa’d! And `Umar (رضي الله عنه) said: By Allah, we never encountered any problem greater than the swearing of allegiance to Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) . We were afraid that if we left the people without having sworn allegiance to anyone, they might swear allegiance after we were gone, so we would either follow in their footsteps and swear allegiance to someone we were not pleased with, or we would disagree with them and that would cause trouble. If anyone swears allegiance to a leader without consulting the Muslims, there is no allegiance for him and no allegiance to the one who swore allegiance to him, lest both of them be killed. Malik said: Ibn Shihab told me, from `Urwah bin az-Zubair, that the men whom they met were `Uwaim bin Sa`idah and Ma`n bin `Adiyy. Ibn Shihab said. Sa`eed bin al-Musayyab told me that the one who said, I am the post on which the camel with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree, was al-lubab bin al-Mundhir.";Musnad Ahmad 391, Book 3, Hadith 1;question #4;How did 'Umar ibn al-Khattab plan to address the issue of leadership succession after his death?

He said: Why shouldn`t I tell you the truth? She said: Tell me about them. He said: When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) corresponded with Mu`awiyah and the two arbitrators gave their verdict, eight thousand of the pious rebelled against him and camped in a land called Haroora`, near Koofah. They criticised him and said: You have taken off a chemise that Allah caused you to wear and a title that Allah gave to you, then you went ahead and asked people to issue a decree concerning the religion of Allah. There is no ruling except the ruling of Allah, may He be exalted. When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) heard about their criticism of him and the reason why they had split from him, he told his caller not to admit anyone but those who had memorised the Qur`an. When the house was filled with people who had memorised the Qur`an, he called for a large Mushaf and put it front of him, and he started tapping it with his hand, saying: O Mushaf, tell the people. The people called out: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, how could you ask it? It is only ink and paper, but we could speak on the basis of what we understand from it. What do you want? He said: These companions of yours who rebelled, between me and them is the Book of Allah, and Allah says in His Book concerning a woman and a man: `If you fear a breach between them twain (the man and his wife), appoint (two) arbitrators, one from his family and the other from hers; if they both wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation.` [an-Nisa 4:35]. The ummah of Muhammad is more important with regard to life and sanctity than a woman and a man. They got angry with me when I wrote a document between me and Mu`awiyah and wrote `Ali bin Abi Talib [without adding the title Ameer al-Mu`mineen]. But Suhail bin `Amr came to us when we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at al-Hudaibiyah, when he made a peace deal with Quraish, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote, `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.` Suhail said: Do not write, In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He said: What should we write? He said: Write: `In Your Name, O Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Write `Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).` He [Suhail] said: If I knew that you were the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I would not have opposed you. So he wrote: This is what was agreed by Muhammad bin `Abdullah with Quraish. And Allah says in His Book: “Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day` [Al-Ahzab 33:21]. So `Ali sent `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه) to them and I went out with him until we reached the middle of their camp. Ibnul-Kawwa` stood up and addressed the people, saying: O bearers of the Qur`an, this is `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه). Whoever does not know him, I know of the Book of Allah what can tell you about him, He is one of those concerning whom the words `they are a quarrelsome people` [Az-Zukhruf 43:58] were revealed. Tell him to go back to the one who sent him and do not discuss the Book of Allah with him. Their spokesmen stood up and said: By Allah, we will discuss the Book of Allah. If he says something sound and true that we recognise we will follow him, and if he says something false we will reject his false argument. So they discussed the Book with ‘Abdullah for three days, and four thousand of them recanted and all of them repented, including Ibnul-Kawwa`. He took them to `Ali in Koofah, and `Ali sent word to the rest of them, saying: You know the turmoil between us and our opponents. Stay wherever you wish until the ummah of Muhammad (ﷺ) is united. The deal between us and you is that you should not shed any blood that it is forbidden to shed or commit acts of banditry on the roads or do wrong to any Non Muslim under Muslim protection. If you do that, we will declare war, for Allah does not love those who betray. `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) said: O Ibn Shaddad, did he kill them? He said: By Allah, no sooner had he sent this message to them but they committed acts of banditry, shed blood and regarded it as permissible to harm Ahludh-Dhimmah (non-Muslims living under Muslim protection). She said: Do you swear by Allah? He said: I swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other god that this is what happened. She said: I have heard that the people of Iraq are talking and saying dhuth-thuda, dhuth-thuda [i.e., the one with a deformed arm that looks like a breast]. He said: I saw him and I was with ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) when he was examining the slain. He called the people and said: Do you know this one? How many of them came and said: I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so, and I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so. And there was no proof of who he was except that. She said: What did `Ali say when he stood over him, as the people of Iraq claim? He said: I heard him say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. She said: Did you hear him say anything other than that? He said: No, by Allah. She said: Yes, Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. May Allah have mercy on `Ali (رضي الله عنه): it was his habit, if he saw something he liked, to say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. But the people of Iraq fabricated lies against him and added words to what he said.";Musnad Ahmad 656, Book 5, Hadith 92;question #4;What was the outcome of the discussions between Abdullah bin Abbas (رضي الله عنه) and the rebels?

When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died, Fatimah sent word to Abu Bakr saying: Are you the heir of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) or are his family? He said: No, rather his family (are his heirs). She said: Where is the share of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? Abu Bakr said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: `If Allah grants some wealth to a Prophet, then takes his soul. He grants it to the one who took charge after him.` So I have decided to give the benefit of it to the Muslims. She said: That is fine, and you know best what you heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Muhaqalah;Musnad Ahmad 14, Book 1, Hadith 14;question #5;How did Fatimah react to Abu Bakr's explanation about the Prophet's wealth?
"One day the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) got up and prayed Fajr, then he sat until the forenoon, then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled. Then he sat where he was until he had prayed Zuhr, 'Asr and Maghrib, and he did not speak until he had prayed 'isha'. Then he got up and went to his family. The people said to Abu Bakr: Why don't you ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) what is the matter? He did something today that he never did before. So he asked him and he said: `Yes, I was shown what is to come of this world and the Hereafter. The earlier and later generations were gathered in one place and the people got terrified because of that. They went to Adam when the sweat was about to reach their mouths, and they said: O Adam, you are the father of mankind and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose you. Intercede for us with your Lord, He said: I am in the same position as you. Go to your father after your father, to Nooh, “Allah chose Adam, Nooh (Noah), the family of Ibraheem (Abraham) and the family of 'Imran above the 'Alameen (mankind and jinn) (of their times)` (Al 'Imran 3:33}.

Then they will go to Nooh and will say: Intercede with your Lord for us, for Allah chose you and answered your supplication, and He did not leave one of the disbelievers on the Earth (cf. 71:26). He will say: I am not the one you want; go to Ibraheem for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, took him as a close friend (khaleel). So they will go to Ibraheem but he will say: I am not the one you want; go to Moosa, for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, spoke directly to him (cf. 4:164). But Moosa will say: I am not the one you want; go to 'Eesa Ibn Maryam, for he healed those born blind and the lepers, and he brought forth the dead. But 'Eesa will say: I am not the one you want; go to the leader of the sons of Adam, for he is the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection. Go to Muhammad, for he will intercede for you with your Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. Then (the Prophet) will go and Jibreel will come to his Lord and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Give him permission and give him the glad tidings of Paradise. Jibreel will take him and he will fall down in prostration for a week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intercession will be accepted. So he will raise his head, and when he looks at his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, he will fall down in prostration for another week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intersession will be accepted. He will start to fall down in prostration again, but Jibreel (peace be upon him) will take hold of his upper arms and Allah, may he be glorified and exalted, will inspire him to offer a supplication such as no human being was ever inspired with. He will say: `O Lord, You created me as the leader of the sons of Adam, and no boast; the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection, and no boast; there will come to my Cistern more people than there can be between San‘a’ and Allah (Eilat).` Then it will be said: Call the Siddeeq's so that they might intercede. Then it will be said: Call the Prophets. So one Prophet will come with a group, and another Prophet will come with five or six people, and another Prophet will come with nobody. Then it will be said: Call the martyrs so that they might intercede for whoever they want. When the martyrs do that, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: I am the Most Merciful of those who show mercy; I admit to My Paradise anyone who does not associate anything with Me.

So they will enter Paradise. Then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look in Hell; can you find anyone who ever did anything good? And they will find a man in Hell, and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that I was easy-going with people in buying and selling. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Be easy-going with My slave as he was easygoing with My slaves. Then they will bring a man out of Hell and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that l instructed my sons: When I die, burn me with fire, then grind me until I am like kohl powder. Then take me to the sea and scatter me in the wind, for by Allah the Lord of the Worlds will never be able to punish me. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Why did you do that? He will say: For fear of You. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look at the kingdom of the greatest king and you will have the like thereof and ten times as much. He will say: Are You making fun of me when You are the Sovereign? He (the Prophet (ﷺ) said: “That is what I was smiling at, at the time of the foremoon.`";Musnad Ahmad 15, Book 1, Hadith 15;question #5;What role does fear of Allah play in the actions and beliefs of a Muslim?

Then Abu Bakr and ‘Umar came together to the people, Abu Bakr spoke and did not omit anything that was revealed concerning the Ansar or that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said concerning them but he mentioned it. And he said: You know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `If the people were to walk in one direction and the Ansar were to walk in another, I would walk in the direction of the Ansar.` I know, O Sa'd, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, when you were sitting here: `Quraish are to be in charge of this affair (Islam), so the righteous people are but followers of the righteous of (Quraish), and the wrongdoers among the people are but followers of the wrongdoers of (Quraish).` Sa'd said to hümn: You have spoken the truth: we are advisers and you are leaders.";Musnad Ahmad 18, Book 1, Hadith 18;question #5;How did Sa'd respond to Abu Bakr's statements regarding the leadership and the role of the Ansar?

'Uthman said: I was one of them. Whilst I was sitting in the shade of a small fort, ‘Umar passed by me and greeted me, and I did not realise that he had passed me or greeted me, ‘Umar went to Abu Bakr and said to him: Do you think it is right that I passed by ‘Uthman and greeted him and he did not return my greeting?

He said: I will not stop doing something that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to do; rather I will continue to do it. I am afraid that if I give up something that he did, I will go astray. As for his charitable endowment in Madinah, 'Umar gave it to 'Ali and 'Abbas, but ‘Ali took most of it.

I said: I have forgotten what I said; remind me. He said: Don't you remember what you said? I said: No, by Allah. He said: Do you remember, when you saw me get angry with that man, you said: Shall I strike his neck, O khaleefah of the Messenger of Allah? Don't you remember that? would you really have done that? I said: Yes, by Allah. If you order me to do it now, I will do it. He said: Woe to you!

"These are the types of charity (zakah) that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made obligatory upon the Muslims and which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, enjoined upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Whoever among the Muslims is asked to pay it in the proper manner, let him give it; whoever is asked for more than that, let him not give it. For less than twenty-five camels, for each five, one sheep (should be given). If the number reaches twenty-five, then one she-camel in its second year (should be given), up to thirty-five. If there is no she-camel in its second year, then a he-camel in its third year (may be given). If the number reaches thirty-six, then a she-camel in its third year (should be given), up to forty-five. If the number reaches forty-six, then a she-camel in its fourth year that has been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to sixty, If the number reaches sixty-one, then a she-camel in its fifth year (should be given), up to seventy five. If the number reaches seventy-six, then two she-camels in their second year (should be given), up to ninety. If the number reaches ninety-one, then two she camels in their fourth year that have been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to one hundred and twenty. If the number is more than one hundred and twenty, then for every forty camels, a she-camel limits third year should be given and for every fifty a she-camel in its fourth year. If the ages of the camels for zakah differ, if what is due is a she-camel in its fifth year but he does not own such a camel, but he has a she-camel in its fourth year, then that will be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, if available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she-camel in its fourth year and he only has a she camel in its fifth year, it should be accepted from him and the zakat collector should give him back twenty dirhams or two sheep. If what is due from him is a shecamel in its fourth year, but he does not have such a cameland he has a she-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, is available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she camel in its second year, but he only has a he-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and nothing should be added to it. If he has only four camels, no zakah is due unless the owner wants to give it. With regard to zakah on sheep in the pasture, if there are forty sheep, then one sheep is due as zakah, up to one hundred and twenty sheep. of there is one more than that, then two sheep are due, up to two hundred. If there is one more than that then three sheep are due, up to three hundred. If there is one more than that, then for every hundred sheep, one sheep is due No toothless or defective sheep should be taken as zakah and neither should a ram, unless the one who is giving allows that. Separate flocks should not be put together and flocks should not be divided so as to avoid or reduce zakah. If there are two partners [and the zakah-collector comes and takes zakah), they should settle the matter between them on a fair basis. If a man's flock is grazing if it is one less than forty, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it. On silver the zakah is one quarter of one tenth; if the wealth is only one hundred and ninety dirhams, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it.";Musnad Ahmad 72, Book 1, Hadith 68;question #5;How is zakah calculated on silver and what is the minimum amount required for it to be due?

Abu Bakr met me and said: Perhaps you felt upset with me when you offered Hafsah to me in marriage and I did not give you any response? I said: Yes. He said: Nothing prevented me from giving you an answer when you offered her to me in marriage except that I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) mention her and I did not want to disclose the private matters of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).

I know what you are going to say. You are going to say: He (the Prophet (ﷺ)) is the son of my brother and I should have half of the wealth. And I know what you are going to say, O 'Ali. You are going to say: His daughter is married to me and she should have half of the wealth. This is what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had, and we saw how he managed it. Then Abu Bakr took charge of it after him, and he dealt with it in the same way as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had dealt with it. Then I took charge after Abu Bakr and I swear by Allah that I will strive my best to deal with it as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr to dealt with it.

The people gathered and he ascended the minbar, which was something that was made for him to deliver speeches, and it was the first speech he gave in Islam. He praised and glorified Allah, then he said: O People, I wish that someone else could have taken care of this for me, for if you compare my way to the way of your Prophet (ﷺ), I cannot be like him, for he was protected from the shaitan and the revelation used to come to him from heaven.;Musnad Ahmad 80, Book 1, Hadith 76;question #5;How did Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq begin his first speech in Islam?

"I saw a dream that I can only interpret as meaning that my death is near; I saw as if a rooster pecked me twice, and I was told that it was a red rooster. I told this dream to Asma’ bint 'Umais, the wife of Abu Bakr , and she said: You will be killed by a Persian man. The people are asking me to appoint a successor, but Allah will not cause His religion and His caliphate, with which He sent His Prophet ﷺ to be lost. If death comes to me soon, then the caliphate is to be decided by these six men with whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was pleased when he died. Whichever of them you swear allegiance to, then listen to him and obey. I know that some people will object to this matter. I have fought them with my own hands in the defence of Islam. 
They are the enemies of Allah and misguided kafirs. By Allah, I am not leaving behind anything that my Lord instructed me to do and I came to the position of caliphate on that basis that is more important to me than kalalah. By Allah, the Prophet of Allah ﷺ never emphasised any issue to me since I accompanied him more than the issue of kalalah, until he poked me in the chest with his finger and said: `Is not ayatas-saif (the verse of summer, i.e., it was revealed in summer), which appears at the end of Sooratan Nisa', sufficient for you?` If I live I will issue a decree that will be so clear that those who read the Qur'an and those who do not read it will be able to make decisions concerning it.

O people, you eat two plants which I find to be nothing but repugnant, this onion and garlic. I remember the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, if he noticed their smell coming from a man in the mosque, he would issue orders that he taken out from the mosque to al-Baqee'.

Then he stood and addressed the people, and said: O people, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made a deal with the Jews of Khaibar on the basis that we could expel them whenever we want. They have attacked 'Abdullah bin ‘Umar and dislocated his arms, as you heard about their attack on the Ansari before him.

And the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was smiling until when I had said too much, he said: `Move away from me, O ‘Umar, for I was given the choice and I have chosen. It was said: `Whether you (O Muhammad) ask forgiveness for them (hypocrites) or ask not forgiveness for them- (and even) if you ask seventy times for their forgiveness-Allah will not forgive them' [at-Tawbah 9:80]. If I knew that by asking for forgiveness more than seventy times they would be forgiven, I would have done that.` He said: Then he offered the funeral prayer for him, and walked with him (his bier), and stood by his grave until the burial was completed. He said: I was astounded that I had spoken so audaciously to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ; Allah and His Messenger know best.

Certainly they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and died while they were Fasiqoon (rebellious, - disobedient to AIlah and His Messenger).`[at-Tawbah9:84].

The Prophet ﷺ would give me some payment and I would say: Give it to one who is more in need of it than me. One day he gave me something and I said: Give it to one who is more in need of it than me. The Prophet ﷺ said: `Take it, keep it, and give it in charity, Whatever of this wealth comes to you when you are not hoping for it or asking for it, accept it, but if it does not come to you, do not hope for it.”;Musnad Ahmad 100, Book 2, Hadith 19;question #5;How did 'Umar bin al-Khattab's experience reflect the teachings of the Prophet ﷺ on wealth and charity?

The Prophet of Allah(ﷺ) turned to face the qiblah, then he stretched forth his hands, wearing his upper and lower garment, and he said: “O Allah, where is Your promise to me? O Allah, accomplish for me what You have promised me! O Allah, if this small band of Muslims is destroyed, You will never be worshipped on earth.” He kept beseeching his Lord, calling out to Him, until his upper garment fell from his shoulders. Abu Bakr came to him, picked up his upper garment and put it on him. Then he embraced him from behind and said: O Prophet of Allah, this prayer of yours to your Lord will suffice, for He will accomplish for you what He has promised to you. Then Allah revealed the words: `(Remember) when you sought help of your Lord and He answered you (saying): ‘I will help you with a thousand of the angels each behind the other (following one another) in succession` [al Anfal 8:9). On that day when the armies met (in battle), Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, defeated the mushrikeen; seventy of their men were killed and seventy were taken captive. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) consulted Abu Bakr, 'Ali and 'Umar رضي الله عنهم (concerning the prisoners).

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: “What do you think, O son of al-Khattab?` I said: No, by Allah. I do not think as Abu Bakr thinks. I think that you should hand. So and so ­ a relative of ʼUmar's- ­ over 
to me so that I may strike his neck. You should hand ‘Aqeel over to ‘Ali so that he may strike his neck, and you should hand over So and so to Hamzah (his brother) so that he may strike his neck, so that Allah will know that we have no mercy in our hearts towards the mushrikeen; these are 
their prominent figures and leaders. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  inclined towards the view of Abu Bakr, and he did not incline towards what I said, and accepted ransoms from them. The next day, I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and found him with Abu Bakr, and they were both weeping I said: O Messenger of Allah , tell me why you and your companion are weeping. If I find it is a cause for weeping, I will weep too, and is it is not, then I will make myself weep with you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `I am weeping because of what your companions suggested about accepting a ransom for the prisoners. I have been shown your punishment as close as this tree` ­ a tree that was close to the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) Then Allah revealed the words:`It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land. You desire the good of this world (i.e. the money of ransom for freeing the captives), but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter. And Allah is Almighty, All Wise.

your mother be bereft of you. O son of al-Khattab, you spoke to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) three times and he did not answer you. So I got on my mount and went on ahead, fearing that something had been revealed concerning me. Then I heard someone calling out: O 'Umar! Where is ‘Umar? I went back, thinking that something had been revealed concerning me, and the Prophet (ﷺ) said: `Yesterday a soorah was revealed to me that is dearer to me than this world and everything in it: ‘Verily, We have given you (O Muhammad ﷺ) a manifest victory.

When  'Ammar came, he said: Were you there on the day when the Bedouin brought the rabbit to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? ('Ammar) said: Yes. ('Umar] said: I saw blood on it, but he (the Prophet (ﷺ) said: `Eat it.` (The Bedouin) said: I am fasting.

On the day of Badr, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) looked at his companions and they were three hundred and some, then he looked at the mushrikeen and saw that they were one thousand or more. The Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) turned to face the qiblah, then he stretched forth his hands, wearing his upper and lower garment, and he said: “O Allah, where is Your promise to me? O Allah, accomplish for me what You have promised me! O Allah, if this small band of Muslims is destroyed, You will never be worshiped on earth.” He kept beseeching his Lord, calling out to Him, until his upper garment fell from his shoulders. Abu Bakr came to him, picked up his upper garment and put it back on him. Then he embraced him from behind and said, “O Prophet of Allah, this prayer of yours to your Lord will suffice, for He will accomplish for you what He has promised to you.” Then Allah revealed the words: “(Remember) when you sought help of your Lord and He answered you (saying): ‘I will help you with a thousand of the angels each behind the other (following one another) in succession’” (al-Anfal 8:9). On that day when the armies met (in battle), Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, caused the mushrikeen to be defeated, seventy of their men were killed and seventy were taken captive. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) consulted Abu Bakr, ‘Ali and ʼUmar (concerning the prisoners). Abu Bakr said, “O Prophet of Allah, they are our cousins, kinsmen and brothers. I think that you should accept a ransom for them, which will strengthen us against the kuffar, and perhaps Allah will guide them to Islam and they will become a support to us.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, “What do you think, O son of al-Khattab?” I said: No, by Allah. I do not think as Abu Bakr thinks. I think that you should hand so and so—a relative of ‘Umar's—to me so that I may strike his neck, You should hand ‘Aqeel over to ‘Ali so that he may strike his neck, and you should hand over so and so to Hamzah (his brother) so that he may strike his neck, so that Allah will know that we have no mercy in our hearts towards the mushrikeen; these are their prominent figures and leaders. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) inclined towards the view of Abu Bakr, and he did not incline towards what I said, and accepted ransoms from them. The next day. I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and found him with Abu Bakr, and they were both weeping. I said, “O Messenger of Allah, tell me why you and your companion are weeping. If I find it is a cause for weeping. I will weep too, and if it is not, then I will make myself weep with you.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, “I am weeping because of what your companions suggested about accepting a ransom for the prisoners. I have been shown your punishment as close as this tree”—a tree that was close to the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ). Then Allah revealed the words: “It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land. You desire the good of this world (i.e. the money of ransom for freeing the captives), but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter, And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.

"I was eager to ask 'Umar about the two wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) concerning whom Allah said, “If you two (wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) turn in repentance
to Allah, (it will be better for you), your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet (ﷺ) likes)” [at-Tahreem 66:4], until 'Umar went for Hajj and I went with him. When we were partway there, 'Umar turned aside and I turned aside with him, bringing the jug. He relieved himself, then he came to me and I poured water onto his hands, and he did wudoo’. I said: “O Ameer al -Mu'mineen, who are the two wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) of whom Allah said: ‘If you two (wives of the Prophet (ﷺ)) turn in repentance to Allah, (it will be better for you), your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet (ﷺ) likes)’?” [at-Tahreem 66:4] 'Umar said, “How strange of you, O Ibn  'Abbas”, (az-Zuhri said: By Allah, he did not like the question, but he did not conceal anything.) He said, “They were Hafsah and 'A'ishah.” Then he started to narrate the hadeeth and said: We people of Quraish were a people who dominated women, but when we came to Madinah we found a people who were dominated by their women, and our women started to learn from their women. My house was among Banu Umayyah bin Zaid in al-'Awali. One day I got angry with my wife, and she argued with me. I did not like her to argue with me, but she said: Do you not like me to argue with you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) argue with him, and one of them will forsake him all day until night comes, I went and entered upon Hafsah, and I said: Do
you argue with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? She said: Yes. I said: Does one of you forsake him all day until night comes? She said: Yes. I said: Any one of you who does that is doomed and lost. Does any one of you feel assured that Allah will not be angry with her because of the anger of His
Messenger (ﷺ), for then she will be doomed? Do not argue with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and do not ask him for anything. Ask me for whatever you want. And do not be misled by the fact that your neighbour is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) than
you – referring to 'A'ishah. And ‘Umar said: I had a neighbour among the Ansar. We used to take turns to go down to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He would go down one day and I would go down the next. He would bring me the news of the Revelation and other things, and I would do likewise.
We were saying that Ghassan were shoeing their horses to attack us. My friend went down, then he came to me at night and knocked on my door, then he called out to me. I went out to him and he said: Something terrible has happened! I said: What? Have Ghassan come? He said: No, it is more terrible than that and worse. The Prophet (ﷺ) has divorced his wives! I said: Hafsah is doomed and lost! I thought that this would happen. Then when I had prayed Fajr, I got dressed, then I went down and entered upon Hafsah, who was weeping. I said: Has the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)divorced you? She said: I do not know. He has secluded himself in this loft. I went to a black slave of his and said: Ask for permission for ‘Umar to enter. He went in, then he came out to me and said: I mentioned you to him but he did not say anything, I went away and came to the minbar, where I sat down. By it was a group of people, some of whom were weeping. I sat for a little while, then I could not bear it any longer, so I went to the slave and said: Ask for permission for ‘Umar to enter. He went in, then he came out to me and said: I mentioned you to him but he did not say anything. I turned to leave, then the slave called me and said: Go in, he has given you permission. So I went in and greeted the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with salam. He was resting on a reed mat that had left marks on his side. I said: O Messenger of Allah, have you divorced your wives? He looked up at me and said, “No.” I said: Allah Akbar! if you had seen us, O Messenger of Allah, we Quraish were a people who dominated women, but when we came to Madinah we found a people who were dominated by their women, and our women started to learn from their women. I got angry with my wife one day, and she started to argue with me. I did not like her to argue with me, but she said: Do you not like me to argue with you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) argue with him, and one of them will forsake him all day until night comes. I said: Any one of them who does that is doomed and lost. Does one of them feel assured that Allah will not be angry with her because of the anger of His Messenger (ﷺ),then she will be doomed? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled. I said: O Messenger of Allah, I entered upon Hafsah and I said: Do not be misled by the fact that your neighbour (i.e. ‘Aa'ishah) is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) than you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled again. I said: O Messenger of Allah, may I speak to you freely? He said: “Yes.” So I sat down and looked around the room, and by Allah, I did not see anything in it to please the eye except three hides. I said: Pray to Allah, O Messenger of Allah, to make life prosperous for your ummah, for He has made life prosperous for the Persians and Romans, but they do not worship Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. He sat up straight and said: “Are you doubting. O son of al-Khattab? They are people whose good things have been hastened for them in this world.” I said: Pray for forgiveness for me, O Messenger of Allah. He had sworn that he would not enter upon them for a month, because he was so annoyed with them until Allah rebuked him.";Musnad Ahmad 222, Book 2, Hadith 139;question #5;What lesson can be learned from the Prophet's lifestyle in comparison to the Persians and Romans?
l heard 'Umar bin al-Khattab say: When the Revelation came down to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), a sound could be heard near his face like the buzzing of bees.

He [as-Subayy] said: It was as if my camel was on my shoulders [i.e., because he was so upset by their words]. I went to ‘Umar and told him about that. ‘Umar said to me: They did not say anything (that matters); you have been guided to the Sunnah of your Prophet (ﷺ).";Musnad Ahmad 254, Book 2, Hadith 168;question #5;What role do companions or peers play in shaping one's understanding of religious duties?

He said: `Have you brought a sacrificial animal?` I said: No. He said: “Circumambulate the House and go between as-Safa and al-Marwah, then exit ihraam.” So I circumambulated the House and went between as-Safa and al-Marwah, then I went to a woman of my people and she combed my hair and washed my head.

`Umar said: Allah, may He be exalted, sent Muhammad (ﷺ) and sent down the Book to him. Among that which was revealed to him was the verse of stoning. We recited it and understood it. But I fear that with the passage of time, some people will say: We do not find the verse of stoning in the Book of Allah, and as a result an obligation that Allah revealed will be forsaken.

"‘Umar said to me: Haven`t I been told that you do certain tasks for the state, then when you are given payment you do not accept it? He said: Yes. He said: Why do you do that? He said: I am well off and I have slaves and horses; I want my work to be a charity to the Muslims. He said: Do not do that, for I used to do what you are doing, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would give me payment, and I would say: Give it someone who is more in need of it than me, And he said: Whatever of this wealth comes to you when you are not hoping for it or asking for it, take it, otherwise do not hanker after it.”It was narrated that as-Sa`ib bin Yazeed said: `Umar met `Abdullah bin as-Sa`di... and he mentioned a similar report, but he said: “Give it in charity,” and he said: “Do not hanker after it.`";Musnad Ahmad 279, 280, Book 2, Hadith 190;question #5;How should one handle wealth that is received unexpectedly according to Islamic teachings?

ʼUmar was a man of protective jealousy, and when he went out to pray, `Atikah bint Zaid would follow him, although he did not like her going out, but he did not like to stop her.

"I heard ‘Umar say: Do not make women`s dowries expensive, do not make women`s dowries expensive, for had this been a sign of honour in this world or piety before Allah, the first one of you to do it would have been the Prophet (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not give any of his wives, and none of his daughters were given, any more than twelve Oasiyyahs [as a dowry. And a man will go to great trouble in order to offer a high dowry to his wife.
On one occasion he said: A man would pay his wife a high dowry until he feels resentment towards her and says: You cost me everything I own, even the string to tie a waterskin and hang it up. He [the narrator] said: I was a young Arab boy with a non-Arab mother, and I did not know what a `string` was. `Umar said: And another thing you say of one who is killed in your campaigns and dies that so and so was killed as a martyr, and o and so died as a martyr. But perhaps he loaded the back of his mount with gold and silver for the purpose of trading. So do not say that, rather say what the Prophet (ﷺ) (or what Muhammad) (ﷺ) said: “Whoever is killed or dies for the sake of Allah will be in Paradise.`";Musnad Ahmad 285, Book 2, Hadith 195;question #5;What is the Islamic perspective on martyrdom and its conditions?
"`Umar bin al-Khattab gave a speech and said: O people, we used to know you when the Prophet (ﷺ) was among us and revelation was coming down to him; Allah would tell us about you. But now the Prophet (ﷺ) has passed away and revelation has ceased, and now the way to judge you is this whoever among you shows us good conduct, we will think well of him and love him; whoever among you shows us bad conduct, we will think badly of him and hate him for that, and whatever is in your hearts is between you and your Lord. There was a time when I used to think that whoever learned the Qur`an, seeking thereby Allah and (the reward that) is with Him, would be rewarded in the Hereafter, but some men learned Qur`an seeking that which is with people. So seek Allah by learning Qur`an and by your good deeds. By Allah, I do not send my workers to strike you or seize your wealth; rather I send them to you to teach you your religion and Sunnah, whoever has done to him something other than that, let him refer it to me, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, I shall surely grant him retaliation. `Amr bin al-`As stood up and said: O Ameer al Mu`mineen, do you think if one of the Muslims was in charge of some people and he disciplined one of them, would you allow that one to settle the score with him? He said: Yes, by the One in Whose hand is the soul of `Umar, I would not certainly allow him to settle the score with him. I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) do that with regard to himself. But do not strike the Muslims and thus humiliate them, and do not keep them away from their wives on campaign for too long and thus expose them to temptation. Do not withhold from them their due rights and cause them to rebel; and do not make them camp in an area with a lot of trees, because that will cause them to be scattered.It was narrated that ‘Abul-`Ajfa` as-Sulami said: I heard ‘Umar say: Do not make women`s dowries expensive,... and he mentioned the same hadeeth.";Musnad Ahmad 286, 287, Book 2, Hadith 196;question #5;How should grievances against leaders be addressed in an Islamic context?
"I was sitting beside Ibn ‘Umar, and we were waiting for the funeral of Umm Aban bint `Uthman bin `Affan. `Amr bin `Uthman was also present. Ibn ‘Abbas came, led by a guide, who told him where Ibn ‘Umar was. He came and sat beside me, so I was between them, and we heard a voice from inside the house, Ibn `Umar said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: `The deceased is tormented because of the crying of his family.` He said: And `Abdullah understood it as general in meaning. Ibn `Abbas said: We were with Ameer al-Muʼmineen ‘Umar until we came to some arid land, where we found a man who had halted in the shade of a tree. He said to me: Go and find out for me who that man is, I went and found that it was Suhaib. I came back to him and said: You told me to find out for you who that man is; it is Suhaib. He said: Tell him to join us. I said: He has his family with him. He said: Even if he has his family with him [and perhaps Ayyoob said on one occasion:Tell him to join us). When we came to Madinah, it was not long before Ameer al Muʼmineen [ʼUmar} was attacked. Suhaib came, saying O my brother, O my friend! `Umar said: Do you not know, or have you not heard, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `The deceased is tormented because of some of his family`s crying.” “Abdullah understood it as general in meaning, but ‘Umar said: some of [their] weeping. I went to `A`ishah, and I told her what Ibn `Umar had said. She said: No, by Allah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not say, “The deceased is tormented because of the weeping of anyone.” Rather he said: “Allah increases the torment of the kafir because of his family`s weeping, and that it is He (Allah) Who makes (whom He wills) laugh, and makes (whom He wills) weep, “And no bearer of burdens shall bear another`s burden` [Al Anʼam 6:164].” Ayyoob said: Ibn Abu Mulaikah said: al-Qasim bin Muhammad told me: When `Aʼishah heard what ʼUmar and Ibn `Umar had said, she said. You are narrating to me from two who are not liars and are not to be suspected of being liars, but one may mishear.`Abdullah bin Abi Mulaikah narrated… and he mentioned a hadeeth similar to that of Ayyoob, except that he said: ibn `Umar said to `Amr bin `Uthman, when he was facing him: Why don`t you tell them not to weep? For the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `The deceased is tormented because of his family`s weeping for him.`";Musnad Ahmad 288, 289, Book 2, Hadith 197;question #5;What is the importance of verifying the authenticity and context of a hadith before accepting its meaning?
A daughter of `Uthman bin `Affan died in Makkah and Ibn `Umar and Ibn `Abbas attended her funeral. I was sitting between them and ibn `Umar said to ‘Amr bin `Uthman, who was facing him: why don`t you tell them not to weep? For I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: `The deceased is tormented because of his family`s weeping for him.` And he mentioned a hadeeth similar to that of Isma`eel from Ayyoob from Ibn Abu Mulaikah.;Musnad Ahmad 290, Book 2, Hadith 198;question #5;How should Muslims approach the practice of mourning based on prophetic traditions?

"`Umar would swear an oath three times, saying: By Allah, no one has more right to this wealth than anyone else, I have no more right to it than anyone else; there is no Muslim who does not have a share in this wealth, except a slave, but it is to be divided according to our categories in the light of the Book of Allah and our closeness to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Thus it is to be given on the basis of a man`s efforts for the sake of lslam, his seniority in Islam, his support for Islam, and his need. By Allah, if I live, a shepherd in the mountains of San‘a’ will get his share of that wealth when he is tending his flock.";Musnad Ahmad 292, Book 2, Hadith 200;question #5;What is the significance of ensuring that even remote individuals receive their share of wealth in Islam?

So they sent for an Arab doctor who gave ʼUmar nabeedh, and the nabeedh was mixed with blood when it came out of the stab wound that was beneath his navel. I [Ibn ‘Umar) called another doctor from among the Ansar, from the tribe of Banu Mu`awiyah. He gave him milk to drink and it came out of the wound solid and white, The doctor said to him: O Ameer al Mu’mineen, give your final instructions, `Umar said: The man from Banu Mu`awiyah has spoken the truth. If you had said anything else I would not have believed you. The people wept for him when they heard that, but he said: Do not weep for us; whoever wants to weep, let him leave.

l heard `Umar bin al Khattab say: The people of Jahiliyyah used not to move on from Jam` until they saw the sun shining on (the mountain of) Thabeer, and they would say: Shine Thabeer, then we will move on swiftly.

I passed by Hisham bin Hakeem bin Hizam when he was reciting Sooratal-Furqan during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I listened to his recitation and he was reciting in a manner different from the way in which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had taught me to recite it. I was about to interrupt him whilst he was praying, but I waited until he finished his prayer, and then I tied his garment around his neck. I said to him: Who taught you this soorah that you are reciting? He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) taught it to me. I said to him: You are lying by Allah! He taught me this soorah that you recited. I brought him to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said, `O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I heard this man reciting Sooratal-Furqan in a way different to the way you taught it to me, and you taught me Sooratal-Furqan, The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Let him go, O `Umar: Recite it, O Hisham. So he recited it to him as I had heard him recite it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, `Thus it was revealed.` Then he said to me, `Recite it,” so I recited it and he said, “Thus it was revealed.` Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is said: `This Qur`an has been revealed in seven different ways, so recite it in the way that is easiest for you.”It was narrated from al Miswar bin Makhramah and `Abdur-Rahman bin Abdul-Qari that  they heard Umar bin al Khattab say: I passed by Hisham bin Hakeem bin Hizam when he was reciting Sooratal-Furqan during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).

I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: “Action is but by intention and each person will have but that which he intended.

I know that there are some men then who will seek to undermine this matter, and I have sought them with these two hands of mine in support of Islam. It they do that, then those are the enemies of Allah, the misguided disbelievers. By Allah, I am not leaving behind anything of more concern to me than kalalah.

Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, ask Him for support, for Muhammad (ﷺ) was caused to prevail on the day of Badr with fewer than your numbers. When this letter of mine reaches you, fight them without referring back to me. So we fought them, and we defeated them, pursuing and killing them for four parasangs, and we acquired wealth (booly).

He left at midday and went to ‘Umar(رضي الله عنه), and he went and came back within nineteen days. He said: Were it not that I think well of you, I would have thought that you did not convey my message. He said: Yes I did convey it, he conveys his salam and apologises, and he swore by Allah that he did not say that. He said: Did he give you any provisions? He said: No. He said: What prevented you from supplying (sufficient, provisions to me yourself? He said: I did not want to instruct that you be given the cold whilst I had the hot [i.e., I could not have given you what you wanted of food and enjoyed plentiful food myself, when around me are the people of Madinah who are starving, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  say: `No man should eat his fill when his neighbour is going without.”;Musnad Ahmad 390, Book 2, Hadith 291;question #5;What did the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) say about eating one's fill while a neighbor is hungry?
"I used to recite to ‘AbdurRahman bin ‘Awf, and he found me waiting for him. That was in Mina during the last Hajj performed by `Umar bin al-Khattab (رضي الله عنه) Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf said: A man came to `Umar bin al-Khattab and said: So and so is saying: If `Umar (رضي الله عنه) dies, I will swear allegiance to So and so. ʼUmar (رضي الله عنه) said: I will stand before the people today and warn them against these people who want to deprive them of their rights, `Abdur-Rahman said: I said: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, do not do that, for the Hajj season brings together the riffraff and rabble among the people, and most of the people who gather around and listen to you will be of that type. Is you stand before the people, I am afraid that you will say something that they will spread and not understand it properly or interpret it properly. Rather wait until you come to Madinah, for it is the land of Hijrah and the Sunnah, and you will meet the most knowledgeable and noble people there, and you can say what you want to say with confidence; they wilt understand what you say and will interpret it correctly, `Umar (رضي الله عنه) said: If I reach Madinah safe and sound, I shall certainly talk to the people there in the first speech I deliver. When we came to Madinah at the end of Dhul-I-Iijah, it was a Friday. I set out early, ‘Umar did not care at what time he went out, because he did not pay attention to heat and cold and so on. I found Sa`eed bin Zaid at the right-hand corner of the minbar, he had got there before me. I sat down next to him, with my knee touching his knee, and it was not long before `Umar (رضي الله عنه)came. When I saw him, I said: He will certainly speak today on this minbar and say something that no one ever heard before. Sa`eed bin Zaid objected to that and said: What do you think he will say that no one said before? `Umar (رضي الله عنه)sat on the minbar, and when the mu`dhdhin fell silent, he stood up and praised and glorified Allah as He deserves, then he said: To proceed o people, I am going to tell you something that it has been decreed I should say. I do not know, perhaps it may signal my death. So whoever understands it and remembers it, let him narrate it to others wherever his mount takes him; whoever does not understand il, it is not permissible for him to tell lies about me. Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, sent Muhammad (ﷺ) with the truth and revealed the Book to him; among the things that were revealed to him was the verse of stoning [adulterers). We read it and understood it; the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stoned [adulterers] and we stoned adulterers] after him. But I fear that with the passage of time, some people will say: We do not find the verse of stoning in the Book of Allah, thus they will go astray by forsaking an  obligation that Allah revealed. Stoning is the due punishment in the Book of Allah for those who commit zina, both men and women, if they have been married and if proof is established, or there is a pregnancy or a confession, And we used to recite: Do not claim to be the offspring of anyone other than your fathers, as it is disbelief (or ingratitude) on your part to claim to be the offspring of anyone other than your fathers, Verily the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Do not praise me excessively as `Eesa, the son of Maryam, was praised; rather I am the slave of Allah, so say, the slave of Allah and His Messenger.` I have heard that some among you are saying. If `Umar (رضي الله عنه) dies, I shall swear allegiance to So and so. No man should deceive himself by saying that the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was is successful. There is no doubt that this is the case, but Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, saved the to 2 people from its bad consequences and there is no one among you today who has the qualities of Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) What happened to us when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died was that ‘Ali, az-Zubair and those who were with them stayed behind in the house of Fatimah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and all the Ansar stayed behind and gathered in Saqeefat Banu Sa`idah, whilst the Muhajireen gathered around Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) I said to him; O Abu Bakr, let us go to our brothers, the Ansar. So we set out, looking for them, then we were met by two righteous men who told us what the people had done, and said: where are you going, O Muhajireen? I said: We are looking for these brothers of ours, the Ansar, They said. You should not go near them; do whatever you have already decided, O Muhajireen. I said: By Allah, we will go to them. So we carried on until we came to them in Saqeefat Banu Sa`idah, where we found them gathered and among them was a man wrapped up [in a garment. I said: Who is this? They said: Sa`d bin `Ubadah. ! said: What is the matter with him? They said: He is sick. After we sat down, their spokesman stood up and praised and glorified Allah, may He glorified and exalted, as He deserves, then he said: To proceed. We are the supporters (Ansar) of Allah and the majority of the Muslim army. You, O Muhajireen, are a small group among us. Some of you came to us, wanting to deny who we are and prevent us from attaining a position of authority. When he fell silent, I wanted to present a speech that I had prepared and that I liked in front of Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) I used to avoid provoking him and he was more forbearing and more dignified than me. But Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) said: Wait a while. I did not like to make him angry, and he was more knowledgeable and more dignified than me. By Allah, he did not omit any word that I liked in the speech I had prepared but he said something like it or better, speaking spontaneously, until he finished speaking. Then he said: To proceed. Whatever you have mentioned about your achievements and virtues, is correct. The Arabs would not acknowledge the leadership of anyone except someone from this tribe of Quraish, for they are the best of the Arabs in lineage and location. I am pleased to suggest to you one of these two men, whichever of them you want. Then he took hold of my hand and the hand of Abu `Ubaidah bin al-Jarrah, and I disliked nothing of what he had said apart from this, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck struck for no sin on my part than to become the leader of people among whom was Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) unless my own self suggested something at the time of death. One of the Ansar said: I am the post on which the camel with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree [i.e., a noble]. [I suggest] a ruler from among us and a ruler from among you, O Quraish. - I the narrator said to Malik; What does ‘I am the post on which the cainc! with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree` mean? He said:It is as if he is saying, I am the smart one who has the answer. - Then there was a great deal of clamour and raised voices, to such an extent that I feared there would be a conflict, so I said: Hold out your hand, O Abu Bakr. So he held out his hand and I swore allegiance to him, and the Muhajireen swore allegiance to him, then the Ansar swore allegiance to him. Thus we surrounded Sa`d bin ‘Ubadah. One of them said: You have killed Sa`d i said: May Allah kill Sa’d! And `Umar (رضي الله عنه) said: By Allah, we never encountered any problem greater than the swearing of allegiance to Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) . We were afraid that if we left the people without having sworn allegiance to anyone, they might swear allegiance after we were gone, so we would either follow in their footsteps and swear allegiance to someone we were not pleased with, or we would disagree with them and that would cause trouble.

"`Abdullah bin Shaddad came and entered upon `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) when we were sitting with her, as he was returning from Iraq during the time when ‘Ali           (رضي الله عنه) was murdered. She said to him: O `Abdullah bin Shaddad, will you tell me the truth about what I am going to ask you? Tell me about these people whom ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) killed. He said: Why shouldn`t I tell you the truth? She said: Tell me about them. He said: When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) corresponded with Mu`awiyah and the two arbitrators gave their verdict, eight thousand of the pious rebelled against him and camped in a land called Haroora`, near Koofah. They criticised him and said: You have taken off a chemise that Allah caused you to wear and a title that Allah gave to you, then you went ahead and asked people to issue a decree concerning the religion of Allah. There is no ruling except the ruling of Allah, may He be exalted. When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) heard about their criticism of him and the reason why they had split from him, he told his caller not to admit anyone but those who had memorised the Qur`an. When the house was filled with people who had memorised the Qur`an, he called for a large Mushaf and put it front of him, and he started tapping it with his hand, saying: O Mushaf, tell the people. The people called out: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, how could you ask it? It is only ink and paper, but we could speak on the basis of what we understand from it. What do you want? He said: These companions of yours who rebelled, between me and them is the Book of Allah, and Allah says in His Book concerning a woman and a man: `If you fear a breach between them twain (the man and his wife), appoint (two) arbitrators, one from his family and the other from hers; if they both wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation.` [an-Nisa 4:35]. The ummah of Muhammad is more important with regard to life and sanctity than a woman and a man. They got angry with me when I wrote a document between me and Mu`awiyah and wrote `Ali bin Abi Talib [without adding the title Ameer al-Mu`mineen]. But Suhail bin `Amr came to us when we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at al-Hudaibiyah, when he made a peace deal with Quraish, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote, `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.` Suhail said: Do not write, In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He said: What should we write? He said: Write: `In Your Name, O Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Write `Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).` He [Suhail] said: If I knew that you were the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I would not have opposed you. So he wrote: This is what was agreed by Muhammad bin `Abdullah with Quraish. And Allah says in His Book: “Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day` [Al-Ahzab 33:21]. So `Ali sent `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه) to them and I went out with him until we reached the middle of their camp. Ibnul-Kawwa` stood up and addressed the people, saying: O bearers of the Qur`an, this is `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه). Whoever does not know him, I know of the Book of Allah what can tell you about him, He is one of those concerning whom the words `they are a quarrelsome people` [Az-Zukhruf 43:58] were revealed. Tell him to go back to the one who sent him and do not discuss the Book of Allah with him. Their spokesmen stood up and said: By Allah, we will discuss the Book of Allah. If he says something sound and true that we recognise we will follow him, and if he says something false we will reject his false argument. So they discussed the Book with ‘Abdullah for three days, and four thousand of them recanted and all of them repented, including Ibnul-Kawwa`. He took them to `Ali in Koofah, and `Ali sent word to the rest of them, saying: You know the turmoil between us and our opponents. Stay wherever you wish until the ummah of Muhammad (ﷺ) is united. The deal between us and you is that you should not shed any blood that it is forbidden to shed or commit acts of banditry on the roads or do wrong to any Non Muslim under Muslim protection. If you do that, we will declare war, for Allah does not love those who betray. `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) said: O Ibn Shaddad, did he kill them? He said: By Allah, no sooner had he sent this message to them but they committed acts of banditry, shed blood and regarded it as permissible to harm Ahludh-Dhimmah (non-Muslims living under Muslim protection). She said: Do you swear by Allah? He said: I swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other god that this is what happened. She said: I have heard that the people of Iraq are talking and saying dhuth-thuda, dhuth-thuda [i.e., the one with a deformed arm that looks like a breast]. He said: I saw him and I was with ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) when he was examining the slain. He called the people and said: Do you know this one? How many of them came and said: I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so, and I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so. And there was no proof of who he was except that. She said: What did `Ali say when he stood over him, as the people of Iraq claim? He said: I heard him say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. She said: Did you hear him say anything other than that? He said: No, by Allah. She said: Yes, Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. May Allah have mercy on `Ali (رضي الله عنه): it was his habit, if he saw something he liked, to say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. But the people of Iraq fabricated lies against him and added words to what he said.";Musnad Ahmad 656, Book 5, Hadith 92;question #5;What conditions did Ali (رضي الله عنه) set for the rebels to maintain peace?

He said: “Go.` So he went then he came back and said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I did not leave in it any idol but I broke it, or any grave but i levelled it, or any image but I spoiled it.

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: They are one thousand; each camel is for one hundred men. Then a shower of rain fell on us at night and we rushed to seek shelter beneath the trees and leather shields, sheltering from the rain. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) spent the night calling upon his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, saying: “O Allah, if You cause this band to be destroyed, You will never be worshipped.” When dawn came, he called out: `Prayer, O slaves of Allah!” And the people came from beneath the trees and shields and the Messenger of Allah led us in prayer and encouraged us to fight. Then he said: `The army of Quraish is beneath this red outcrop of the mountain.` When the people drew close to us, and we stood in ranks facing one another, we saw one of their men, riding a red camel of his, going around among the people. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `O `Ali, call Hamzah for me` - as he was the closest of them to the mushrikeen - and said `Who is the one on the red camel and what is he saying to them?` Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: `If there is anyone among the people who is enjoining good, then perhaps it is the one on the red camel.` Hamzah came and said: He is `Utbah bin Rabee`ah, and he is telling them not to fight; he is saying to them: O people, I can see people who are going to fight to the death and you will never be able to harm them, because it will cost you too dear to do so. O people, put the blame on me and say: `Utbah bin Rabee`ah is a coward, although you know that I am not the most cowardly among you. Abu Jahl heard that and said: Are you saying this? By Allah, if anyone else said this I would have insulted him; you are filled with fear, ‘Utbah said: Do you mean me, O you with the whistling rear end (i.e., one who breaks wind a great deal because of fear)? Today you will know which of us is the coward. Then ‘Utbah and his brother Shaibah and his son al-Waleed stepped forward in a display of courage and said: Who will come out to fight in single combat? Six young men of the Ansar stepped forward, but `Utbah said: We do not want these; let some of our cousins of Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib come out. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Get up, O Ali, get up, O Hamzah, get up, O `Ubaidah bin al-Harith bin ‘Abdul-Muttalib.` Allah caused `Utbah and Shaibah, the two sons of Rabee`ah, and al-Waleed bin ‘Utbah to be killed and ‘Ubaidah was wounded. We killed seventy of them and captured seventy. A short Ansari man brought al-Abbas bin `Abdul-Muttalib as a captive, and al-`Abbas said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), by Allah, this is not the one who captured me; I was captured by a bold man who was one of the most handsome of people, who was riding a piebald horse, but I do not see him among the people. The Ansari said: I captured him, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: `Be quiet! Allah, may He be exalted, supported you with a noble angel.` `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: We took prisoners, and from among Banu `Abdul-Muttalib, we captured al-`Abbas, ‘Aqeel and Nawfal bin al-Harith.";Musnad Ahmad 948, Book 5, Hadith 375;question #5;What was the significance of the rain that fell on the Muslim army before the Battle of Badr?

But I will go out with you and sit with you. Offer your camels for sale and if a man comes and makes you an offer and I think he is honest and sincere, I will tell you to sell to him. So we went out to the marketplace and showed the mounts that we had for sale, and Talhah sat nearby. People made offers to us, then when a man offered what we wanted, my father said to Talhah: “Shall I sell to him?” He said: “Yes, I am sure he is honest. So sell to him.” So we sold to him. Then when we took our money and ended our business, my father said to Talhah: “Ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for a document for us, stating that no one should transgress against us with regard to our zakah.” (Talhah) said: “This is your right and it is the right of every Muslim.” He said: “Nevertheless, I would like to have a document from the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ).” So he took us out and brought us to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: “O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), this man is a man of the desert and is a friend of ours. He would like you to write a document for him, stating that no one should transgress against him with regard to his zakah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `That is his right and it is the right of every Muslim.” He said: “O, Messenger of Allah, he would like to have something from you in writing concerning that.” So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote this document for us.”;Musnad Ahmad 1404, Book 6, Hadith 22;question #5;What does this narration teach about the relationship between townsmen and Bedouins in business dealings?

I smoothed the ground for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and spread a garment of camel hair for him, and said: Lie down and rest, O Messenger of Allah.

The people said to Abu Bakr: Why don't you ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) what is the matter? He did something today that he never did before. So he asked him and he said: `Yes, I was shown what is to come of this world and the Hereafter.

They went to Adam when the sweat was about to reach their mouths, and they said: O Adam, you are the father of mankind and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose you. Intercede for us with your Lord, He said: I am in the same position as you. Go to your father after your father, to Nooh, “Allah chose Adam, Nooh (Noah), the family of Ibraheem (Abraham) and the family of 'Imran above the 'Alameen (mankind and jinn) (of their times)` (Al 'Imran 3:33}.

Then they will go to Nooh and will say: Intercede with your Lord for us, for Allah chose you and answered your supplication, and He did not leave one of the disbelievers on the Earth (cf. 71:26). He will say: I am not the one you want; go to Ibraheem for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, took him as a close friend (khaleel). So they will go to Ibraheem but he will say: I am not the one you want; go to Moosa, for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, spoke directly to him (cf. 4:164). But Moosa will say: I am not the one you want; go to 'Eesa Ibn Maryam, for he healed those born blind and the lepers, and he brought forth the dead. But 'Eesa will say: I am not the one you want; go to the leader of the sons of Adam, for he is the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection. Go to Muhammad, for he will intercede for you with your Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. Then (the Prophet) will go and Jibreel will come to his Lord and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Give him permission and give him the glad tidings of Paradise. Jibreel will take him and he will fall down in prostration for a week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intercession will be accepted. So he will raise his head, and when he looks at his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, he will fall down in prostration for another week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intersession will be accepted. He will start to fall down in prostration again, but Jibreel (peace be upon him) will take hold of his upper arms and Allah, may he be glorified and exalted, will inspire him to offer a supplication such as no human being was ever inspired with. He will say: `O Lord, You created me as the leader of the sons of Adam, and no boast; the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection, and no boast; there will come to my Cistern more people than there can be between San‘a’ and Allah (Eilat).` Then it will be said: Call the Siddeeq's so that they might intercede. Then it will be said: Call the Prophets. So one Prophet will come with a group, and another Prophet will come with five or six people, and another Prophet will come with nobody. Then it will be said: Call the martyrs so that they might intercede for whoever they want. When the martyrs do that, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: I am the Most Merciful of those who show mercy; I admit to My Paradise anyone who does not associate anything with Me.

So they will enter Paradise. Then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look in Hell; can you find anyone who ever did anything good? And they will find a man in Hell, and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that I was easy-going with people in buying and selling. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Be easy-going with My slave as he was easygoing with My slaves. Then they will bring a man out of Hell and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that l instructed my sons: When I die, burn me with fire, then grind me until I am like kohl powder. Then take me to the sea and scatter me in the wind, for by Allah the Lord of the Worlds will never be able to punish me. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Why did you do that? He will say: For fear of You. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look at the kingdom of the greatest king and you will have the like thereof and ten times as much. He will say: Are You making fun of me when You are the Sovereign? He (the Prophet (ﷺ) said: “That is what I was smiling at, at the time of the foremoon.`";Musnad Ahmad 15, Book 1, Hadith 15;question #6;How is the concept of accountability and reward depicted in the context of the Hereafter in Islam?
Abu Bakr stood up and praised and glorified Allah, then he said: O people, you recite this verse: “O you who believe! Take care of your ownselves. If you follow the (right) guidance...” [al-Ma'idah 5:105], but you do not interpret it properly. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: “If the people see evil and do not change it, soon Allah will send His punishment upon them all.` He (Qais] said: I heard Abu Bakr say: O people, beware of lying for lying is contrary to faith.;Musnad Ahmad 16, Book 1, Hadith 16;question #6;Why is lying considered contrary to faith in Islam?
"A man among the Ansar who was a man of knowledge told me that he heard 'Uthman bin 'Affan (may Allah have mercy on him) narrate that some of the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ), when the Prophet (ﷺ) died, grieved so much that some of thern were almost unaware of what was going on around them. 'Uthman said: I was one of them. Whilst I was sitting in the shade of a small fort, ‘Umar passed by me and greeted me, and I did not realise that he had passed me or greeted me, ‘Umar went to Abu Bakr and said to him: Do you think it is right that I passed by ‘Uthman and greeted him and he did not return my greeting? He and Abu Bakr came, when Abu Bakr had been appointed caliph and they both greeted me. Then Abu Bakr said: Your brother ‘Umar came to me and told me that he passed by you and greeted you but you did not return his greeting; what made you do that? I said: I did not do that. 'Umar said: Yes, by Allah, you did that, but you have too much pride, O Banu Umayyah. I said: By Allah, I did not realise that you had passed me or greeted me. Abu Bakr said: 'Uthman is telling the truth; is something bothering you? I said: Yes. He said: What is it? 'Uthman said: Allah, may He be glorifică and exalted, has caused His Prophet (ﷺ) to die before we could ask him how we can save ourselves, Abu Bakr said: I asked him about that. ('Uthman] said: I went to him and said: May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, you were more deserving to ask it. Abu Bakr said: I said:O Messenger of Allah, what is salvation? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Whoever accepts this word from me that I asked my uncle to say but he rejected it, it is salvation for him.`";Musnad Ahmad 20, Book 1, Hadith 20;question #6;What was the response of the Prophet (ﷺ) when asked about salvation?
"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Our (Prophets') property is not to be inherited and whatever we leave behind is charity.` Fatimah got angry and kept away from Abu Bakr and she continued to do so until she died. Fatimah lived for six months after the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and she used to ask Abu Bakr for her share of that which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had left behind of Khaibar and Fadak, and his charitable endowments in Madinah, but Abu Bakr refused to give her that. He said: I will not stop doing something that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to do; rather I will continue to do it. I am afraid that if I give up something that he did, I will go astray. As for his charitable endowment in Madinah, 'Umar gave it to 'Ali and 'Abbas, but ‘Ali took most of it. As for Khaibar and Fadak, 'Umar kept them and said: They are the charitable endowment of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and were spent on his responsibilities and on emergencies. They were to be cared for by whoever became caliph, and this remains the case until today.";Musnad Ahmad 25, Book 1, Hadith 25;question #6;What was the significance of Khaibar and Fadak in the context of the Prophet's charitable endowments?
“No one will enter Paradise who is treacherous, miserly, reminds people of his favours or mistreats his slaves. The first to enter Paradise will be the slave, if he obeys Allah and obeys his master.`;Musnad Ahmad 32, Book 1, Hadith 32;question #6;What is the role of generosity in achieving spiritual success according to Islamic teachings?
"I heard Sulaim bin 'Amir, a man from Homs who met the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), say - on one occasion he said: I heard Awsat al-Bajali narrate from Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, he said: I heard him addressing the people - and on another occasion he said: when he was appointed as caliph - he said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood last year where I am standing. Abu Bakr wept and said: “I ask Allah for pardon and well-being, for people are never given anything, after certainty of faith, that is better than well being. You should be truthful, for it leads to Paradise, and beware of lying, for it goes with immorality, and they lead to Hell. Do not sever ties with one another, do not hate one another, do not envy one another, do not turn your backs on one another; be brothers, as Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has enjoined you.`";Musnad Ahmad 34, Book 1, Hadith 34;question #6;What does Islam teach about envy and turning one's back on others?
"If Heard something from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), Allah would benefit me thereby as He willed. Abu Bakr told me - and Abu Bakr spoke the truth - he said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `There is no Muslim who commits a sin then does wudu' and prays two rak'ahs then asks Allah for forgiveness for that sin, but He will forgive him.” And he recited these two verses: `And whoever does evil or wrongs himself but afterwards seeks Allah's forgiveness, he will find Allah Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful` [an-Nisa’ 4:110] 
“And those who, when they have committed Fahishah (illegal sexual intercourse) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins;-and none can forgive sins but Allah - and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know` [Al ‘Imran 3:135]Shu'bah said: I heard 'Uthman from the family of Abu 'Aqeel athThaqafi say--but he said. Shu'bah said: And he recited one of these two verses: `whosoever works evil, will have the recompense thereof` [an-Nisa'4:110] or “And those who, when they have committed Fahishah (illegal sexual intercourse)...` [Al 'Imran 3:135).";Musnad Ahmad 47, 48, Book 1, Hadith 46;question #6;What is the importance of not persisting in wrongdoing after seeking forgiveness according to Islamic teachings?
"Fatimah the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent word to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, asking for her inheritance from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), of the fai` that Allah had granted to him in Madinah and Fadak, and what was left of the khurnus of Khaibar, Abu Bakr said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `We (Prophets) are not to be inherited from and whatever we leave behind is charity. Rather the family of Muhammad may take their provision from this wealth.` By Allah, I will not change any of the charity of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) from how it was at the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and I will do the same with it as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did. So Abu Bakr refused to give anything of it to Fatimah, and Fatimah was upset with Abu Bakr because of that. Abu Bakr said; By the One in Whose hand is my soul, the relatives of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) are dearer to me than my own relatives. As for the dispute between me and you concerning this wealth, I did not deviate from the truth concerning them and I will not leave anything that I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) do but I will do it the way he did it.";Musnad Ahmad 55, Book 1, Hadith 52;question #6;How did Abu Bakr justify his actions regarding the Prophet's wealth?
"These are the types of charity (zakah) that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made obligatory upon the Muslims and which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, enjoined upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Whoever among the Muslims is asked to pay it in the proper manner, let him give it; whoever is asked for more than that, let him not give it. For less than twenty-five camels, for each five, one sheep (should be given). If the number reaches twenty-five, then one she-camel in its second year (should be given), up to thirty-five. If there is no she-camel in its second year, then a he-camel in its third year (may be given). If the number reaches thirty-six, then a she-camel in its third year (should be given), up to forty-five. If the number reaches forty-six, then a she-camel in its fourth year that has been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to sixty, If the number reaches sixty-one, then a she-camel in its fifth year (should be given), up to seventy five. If the number reaches seventy-six, then two she-camels in their second year (should be given), up to ninety. If the number reaches ninety-one, then two she camels in their fourth year that have been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to one hundred and twenty. If the number is more than one hundred and twenty, then for every forty camels, a she-camel limits third year should be given and for every fifty a she-camel in its fourth year. If the ages of the camels for zakah differ, if what is due is a she-camel in its fifth year but he does not own such a camel, but he has a she-camel in its fourth year, then that will be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, if available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she-camel in its fourth year and he only has a she camel in its fifth year, it should be accepted from him and the zakat collector should give him back twenty dirhams or two sheep. If what is due from him is a shecamel in its fourth year, but he does not have such a cameland he has a she-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, is available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she camel in its second year, but he only has a he-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and nothing should be added to it. If he has only four camels, no zakah is due unless the owner wants to give it. With regard to zakah on sheep in the pasture, if there are forty sheep, then one sheep is due as zakah, up to one hundred and twenty sheep. of there is one more than that, then two sheep are due, up to two hundred. If there is one more than that then three sheep are due, up to three hundred. If there is one more than that, then for every hundred sheep, one sheep is due No toothless or defective sheep should be taken as zakah and neither should a ram, unless the one who is giving allows that. Separate flocks should not be put together and flocks should not be divided so as to avoid or reduce zakah. If there are two partners [and the zakah-collector comes and takes zakah), they should settle the matter between them on a fair basis. If a man's flock is grazing if it is one less than forty, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it. On silver the zakah is one quarter of one tenth; if the wealth is only one hundred and ninety dirhams, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it.";Musnad Ahmad 72, Book 1, Hadith 68;question #6;What are the guidelines for combining or separating flocks to avoid or reduce zakah obligations?
Hafsah bint 'Umar became the widow of Khunais or Hudhaifah bin Hudhafah - 'Abdur-Razzaq was not certain. He was one of the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) who were present at Badr, and he died in Madinah, I met 'Uthman bin `Affan and offered I Hafsah to him in marriage, I said: If you wish, I will marry Hafsah to you. He said: I will think about it. A few days passed, then he met me and said: I do not want to get married at present. 'Umar said: Then I met Abu Bakr and I said: If you wish, I will marry Hafsah the daughter of ‘Umar to you. He did not give any response to me, and I was more upset with him than with 'Uthman. A few days passed, then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) proposed marriage to her and he gave her in marriage to him. Abu Bakr met me and said: Perhaps you felt upset with me when you offered Hafsah to me in marriage and I did not give you any response? I said: Yes. He said: Nothing prevented me from giving you an answer when you offered her to me in marriage except that I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) mention her and I did not want to disclose the private matters of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). If he had not married her, I would have married her.;Musnad Ahmad 74, Book 1, Hadith 70;question #6;What role does patience play in the process of marriage proposals according to Islamic teachings?
The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “No one who mistreats his slaves will enter Paradise.` Aman said: O Messenger of Allah, didn't you tell us that this ummah is the greatest in numbers of slaves and orphans? He said: `Yes, so treat them kindly as you treat your children and feed them from what you eat.` They said: What could benefit us in this world, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “A good horse which you keep ready for fighting for the sake of Allah and a slave to take care of you. If he prays (becomes Muslim), then he is your brother, if he prays, then he is your brother.”;Musnad Ahmad 75, Book 1, Hadith 71;question #6;What role does a good horse play in the life of a Muslim according to the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)?
"An old man of Quraish, from Banu Taim, told me: So and so, and So and so told me - and he listed six or seven, all of whom were from Quraish, one of whom was 'Abdullah bin az-Zubair, - and said: Whilst we were sitting with ‘Umar, ‘Ali and al-'Abbas came in, and they had been raising their voices. ‘Umar said: Stop, O'Abbas! I know what you are going to say. You are going to say: He (the Prophet (ﷺ)) is the son of my brother and I should have half of the wealth. And I know what you are going to say, O 'Ali. You are going to say: His daughter is married to me and she should have half of the wealth. This is what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had, and we saw how he managed it. Then Abu Bakr took charge of it after him, and he dealt with it in the same way as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had dealt with it. Then I took charge after Abu Bakr and I swear by Allah that I will strive my best to deal with it as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr to dealt with it. Then he said: Abu Bakr told me and he swore by Allah that he was telling the truth, that he heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say: `The Prophet is not to be inherited from; rather his estate is to go to the poor and needy Muslims.` And Abu Bakr told me and swore by Allah that he was telling the truth, that the Prophet (ﷺ) Said: 'No Prophet dies until he has been led in prayer by one of his ummah.` This is what was in the possession of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and we saw how he dealt with it. If you wish, I will give it to you to manage it in the same way as the Messenger of Al!ah (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr did, so that I can put it under your control. They discussed it privately, then they came and al-'Abbas said: Give it to ‘Ali, for I am happy for him to take control of it.";Musnad Ahmad 78, Book 1, Hadith 74;question #6;What is the significance of a Prophet being led in prayer by someone from his ummah before his death?
I was sitting with Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, the successor of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), one month after the death of the Prophet (ﷺ) and he was telling a story, then the call went out among the people, `As-salatu jami'ah (prayer is about to begin),` and it was the first time that this call of `as-salatu jami'ah` went out to the people. The people gathered and he ascended the minbar, which was something that was made for him to deliver speeches, and it was the first speech he gave in Islam. He praised and glorified Allah, then he said: O People, I wish that someone else could have taken care of this for me, for if you compare my way to the way of your Prophet (ﷺ), I cannot be like him, for he was protected from the shaitan and the revelation used to come to him from heaven.;Musnad Ahmad 80, Book 1, Hadith 76;question #6;What does Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq's statement reveal about his humility and understanding of his role?
Which deed is best? He was told: Jihad for the sake of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. He wanted to go for jihad, but it was said to him: Have you done Hajj? He said no. So it was said to him: Go for Haji and 'Umrah, then go for jihad. So he set out and when he was in al-Hawa'it, he entered ihram for both Haji and 'Umrah together, Zaid bin Soohan and Salman bin Rabee'ah saw him and said: He is more astray than his camel, or he is no more guided than his camel. He went to ‘Umar and told him what they had said. He said: You have been guided to the Sunnah of your Prophet  (ﷺ) . Al-Hakam said: I said to Abu Wa'il. Did as-Subayy tell you that? He said: Yes;Musnad Ahmad 83, Book 2, Hadith 2;question #6;What does this narration suggest about the sequence of performing religious duties in Islam?
"I saw a dream that I can only interpret as meaning that my death is near; I saw as if a rooster pecked me twice, and I was told that it was a red rooster. I told this dream to Asma’ bint 'Umais, the wife of Abu Bakr , and she said: You will be killed by a Persian man. The people are asking me to appoint a successor, but Allah will not cause His religion and His caliphate, with which He sent His Prophet ﷺ to be lost. If death comes to me soon, then the caliphate is to be decided by these six men with whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was pleased when he died. Whichever of them you swear allegiance to, then listen to him and obey. I know that some people will object to this matter. I have fought them with my own hands in the defence of Islam. 
They are the enemies of Allah and misguided kafirs. By Allah, I am not leaving behind anything that my Lord instructed me to do and I came to the position of caliphate on that basis that is more important to me than kalalah. By Allah, the Prophet of Allah ﷺ never emphasised any issue to me since I accompanied him more than the issue of kalalah, until he poked me in the chest with his finger and said: `Is not ayatas-saif (the verse of summer, i.e., it was revealed in summer), which appears at the end of Sooratan Nisa', sufficient for you?` If I live I will issue a decree that will be so clear that those who read the Qur'an and those who do not read it will be able to make decisions concerning it. I call upon Allah to bear witness over the governors of the regions, for I only sent them to be just and to teach the people their religion and the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ and to refer to me concerning any difficult matter. O people, you eat two plants which I find to be nothing but repugnant, this onion and garlic. I remember the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, if he noticed their smell coming from a man in the mosque, he would issue orders that he taken out from the mosque to al-Baqee'. Whoever must eat them, let him cook them to death.” 

He said: He addressed the people on Friday and was attacked on Wednesday.";Musnad Ahmad 89, Book 2, Hadith 8;question #6;What responsibilities did 'Umar assign to the governors of the regions in terms of justice and religious education?
"I heard 'Umar bin al-Khattab say: When ‘Abdullah bin Ubayy died, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was called to offer the funeral prayer for him, and when he stood by the deceased and was about to offer the prayer for him. I went and stood before him and said: O Messenger of Allah, (will you offer the funeral prayer) for the enemy of Allah who said such and such? and I listed what he had done. And the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was smiling until when I had said too much, he said: `Move away from me, O ‘Umar, for I was given the choice and I have chosen. It was said: `Whether you (O Muhammad) ask forgiveness for them (hypocrites) or ask not forgiveness for them- (and even) if you ask seventy times for their forgiveness-Allah will not forgive them' [at-Tawbah 9:80]. If I knew that by asking for forgiveness more than seventy times they would be forgiven, I would have done that.` He said: Then he offered the funeral prayer for him, and walked with him (his bier), and stood by his grave until the burial was completed. He said: I was astounded that I had spoken so audaciously to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ; Allah and His Messenger know best. By Allah, it was not long before these two verses were revealed: “And never (O Muhammad pray (funeral prayer) for any of them (hypocrites) who dies, nor stand at his grave. Certainly they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and died while they were Fasiqoon (rebellious, - disobedient to AIlah and His Messenger).`[at-Tawbah9:84]. So after that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ did not offer the funeral prayer for any hypocrite or stand by his grave until he passed away.";Musnad Ahmad 95, Book 2, Hadith 14;question #6;What does the hadith teach about the limits of intercession and forgiveness for hypocrites in Islam?
I went out looking for the Messenger of Allah ﷺ before I became Muslim, and I found that he had reached the mosque before me. I stood behind him and he started to recite Sooratal-Haqqah, and I was amazed by the way in which the Qur'an was composed. I said: By Allah, this man is a poet as Quraish said. Then he recited: `That this is verily, the word of an honoured Messenger [i.e. Jibreel (Gabriel) or Muhammad which he has brought from Allah]. It is not the word of a poet, little is that you believe!” [al-Haqqah 69:40-41]. I said: (He is a) soothsayer. He said: “Nor is it the word of a soothsayer (or a foreteller), little is that you remember! This is the Revelation sent down from the Lord of the 'Alameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists). And if he (Muhammad ﷺ) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah). We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), And then We certainly would have cut off his life artery (aorta), And none of you could have withheld Us from (punishing) him...” [al-Haqqah 69:42—47]. lle said: Then I felt an overwhelming attraction to Islam.;Musnad Ahmad 107, Book 2, Hadith 25;question #6;How does the Qur'an emphasize the divine origin of its message in Surah Al-Haqqah?
I have heard that there is a severe plague in Syria. I said: If my time comes, and Abu ‘Ubaidah bin al-Jarrah is still alive, I appoint him as my successor, And if Allah asks me why I appointed him as my successor to lead the ummah of Muhammad ﷺ , I will say: I heard Your Messenger ﷺ say: `Every Prophet has a close confidant and my close confidant is Abu 'Ubaidah bin al-Jarrah.` The people objected to that, and said: What about the prominent figures of Quraish? meaning Banu Fihr. Then he said: If my time comes, and Abu 'Ubaidah has died, then I appoint Mu'adh bin Jabal as my successor, and if my Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, asks me why I appointed him as my successor, I will say: I heard Your Messenger say:`He will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection as a leader of scholars.`;Musnad Ahmad 108, Book 2, Hadith 26;question #6;How did the people react to 'Umar bin al-Khattab's choices for succession, and what was their concern?
The Messenger of Allah ﷺ  stood before us as I am standing before you, and said: `I urge you to show respect to my Companions, then those who come after them, then those who come after them, then lying will become so widespread that a man will start to give testimony before he is asked to do so.Whoever among you wants to attain a spacious abode in Paradise, let him adhere to the jama'ah (main body of Muslims), for the Shaitan is with the one who is alone, but he is further away from two. And no one of you should be alone with a woman for the Shaitan will be the third one present. The one who is pleased with his good deeds and upset by his bad deeds is a believer.`;Musnad Ahmad 114, Book 2, Hadith 32;question #6;How does the spread of lying affect the integrity of testimony in Islamic teachings?
When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died and Abu Bakr رضي الله عنه became (caliph) after him, and some of the Arabs apostatized,ʻUmar رضي الله عنه said: O Abu Bakr, how can you fight the people when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: `I have been ordered to fight the people until they bear witness that there is no god except Allah. Whoever bears witness that there is no god except Allah has protected his wealth and his life from me, except in cases dictated by Islamic law, and their reckoning will be with Allah`? Abu Bakr رضي الله عنه said: by Allah I shall certainly fight the one who separates prayer and zakah, for zakah is what is due from wealth. By Allah, whoever withholds from me a goat that they used to give (in zakah) to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, I shall fight them for withholding it. 'Umar said: By Allah, as soon as I realized that Allah had opened the heart of Abu Bakr to fighting, I realized that it was the right thing to do.;Musnad Ahmad 117, Book 2, Hadith 35;question #6;What does this incident reveal about the challenges faced by the early Muslim community after the Prophet's death?
“Whoever gets up when the sun has risen and does wudoo’. and does it well, then stands and prays two rak'ahs, his sins will be forgiven him and he will be as his mother bore him.` 'Uqbah bin 'Amir said: I said: Praise be to Allah Who has blessed me by enabling me to hear this from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. 'Umar bin al-Khattab رضي الله عنه, who was sitting in front of me, said to me: Are you surprised by this? The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said something even more amazing than this before you came. I said: What was it, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you? 'Umar said. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ  said: `Whoever does wudoo’ and does it well, then lifts his gaze towards heaven and says, “I bear witness that there is no god but Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger,` the eight gates of Paradise will be opened for him and he may enter by whichever of them he wishes.`;Musnad Ahmad 121, Book 2, Hadith 39;question #6;What is the significance of the eight gates of Paradise in Islamic belief?
"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say: “Whoever shades the head of a fighter (mujahid), Allah will shade him on the Day of Resurrection; whoever equips a fighter until he has all that he needs, will have a reward equal to his until he dies (Yoonus said: or returns); whoever builds a mosque in which the Name of Allah may He be exalted, is remembered,Allah will build for him a house in Paradise.` ,";Musnad Ahmad 126, Book 2, Hadith 44;question #6;What are the spiritual rewards associated with supporting a mujahid?
You should note that I have not said anything about kalalah and I have not appointed anyone to succeed me. Whoever of Arab captives are present when I die, are to be freed although they are among the wealth of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. Sa'eed bin Zaid said: Why don't you suggest a man among the Muslims so that the people may follow your advice? Abu Bakr did that and the people followed his advice and trusted him. ‘Umar said: I have noticed too much greed and ambition, and I will leave this matter to be decided by these six people with whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was pleased when he died. Then ‘Umar said: If one of the two men were still alive, I would have referred to this matter to him and I would have trusted him: Salim the freed slave of Abu Hudhaifah and Abu 'Ubaidah bin al-Jarrah.;Musnad Ahmad 129, Book 2, Hadith 47;question #6;What concerns did Umar bin al-Khattab express about greed and ambition in leadership?

I heard 'Umar bin al Khattab رضي الله عنه say: I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say: ` The martyrs are four: a man who believes and has good faith, who meets the enemy and shows sincerity to Allah until he is killed - he is the one at whom people will look like this`- and he raised his head until the hat of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ or 'Umar's hat fell of. ` The second is a man who is a believer and has good faith, who meets the enemy and it is as if his back was beaten with the thorns of an acacia tree, then a stray arrow comes and kills him- he will be in a the second rank. The third is a man who is a believer, but he mixes good and bad deeds, and he meets the enemy and shows sincerity to Allah until he is killed- he will be in the third rank. The fourth is a believing man who transgresses against himself by committing a great deal of evil deeds and sins, who meets the enemy and shows sincerity to Allah until he is killed- he will be in the fourth rank.`;Musnad Ahmad 150, Book 2, Hadith 67;question #6;How does the concept of martyrdom address those who have committed sins?
addressed us. - He praised and glorified Allah, then he mentioned stoning and said: Do not be diverted away from it, for it is one of the hadd punishments of Allah. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ stoned [adulterers], and we stoned [them] after he was gone. Were it not that some may say that 'Umar added something to the Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, that is not part of it, I would have written it in some place in the Mushaf. 'Umar bin al-Khattab testified - and on one occasion Hushaim said: and 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf and so and so and so and so[also testified] that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stoned [adulterers] and we stoned [them] after he was gone. But there will come people after you who do not believe in stoning, or in the Dajjal, or intercession, or the torment of the grave, or that people will be brought out of Hell after they have been burned in it.;Musnad Ahmad 156, Book 2, Hadith 73;question #6;What are the implications of rejecting certain Islamic beliefs such as the Dajjal or intercession?
Umar said: I agreed with my Lord on three matters, I said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) , why don't we take the Maqam of Ibraheem as a place of prayer? Then the verse was revealed: ` And take you(people) the Maqam (place) of Ibraheem (Abraham) [ or the stone on which Ibraheem (Abraham) stood while he was building the Kabah]as a place of prayer` [al Baqarah 2:125]. And I said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) , both righteous and evil doers enter your wives, so why don't you tell them to observe the hijab? Then the verse of hijab was revealed. And the wives of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ got together as a result of the jealousy between them, and I said to them. ` It may be if he divorced you(all) that his lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you`[at Tahreem 66:5], and it was revealed like that.;Musnad Ahmad 157, Book 2, Hadith 74;question #6;How does this narration reflect the role of companions in shaping Islamic practices and teachings?
"I heard Hisham bin Hakeem bin Hizam reciting Sooratal-Furqan and he recited some words differently from how the Prophet of Allah had taught it to me. I wanted to argue with him, but I was praying. When I finished, I said: Who taught you this recitation? He said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ. I said: You are lying; by Allah, this is not how the Messenger of Allah ﷺ taught it to you. I took him by the hand and brought him to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) , you taught me how to recite Soorat al Furqaan, and I heard this man reciting some words in a way that was not the way you taught them to me. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: `Recite it, O. Hisham.” He recited it as he recited it before. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: `Thus it was revealed.” Then he said: `Recite it, O Umar.” So I recited it and he said: “Thus it was revealed.” Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “The Qur'an has been revealed in seven different ways.`";Musnad Ahmad 158, Book 2, Hadith 75;question #6;How does this narration illustrate the importance of seeking clarification in religious matters?
"I agreed with my Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, in three matters - or my Lord agreed with me in three matters, I said: O Messenger of Allah, why don't you take the Maqarn of Ibraheem as a place of prayer? Then Allah revealed the verse: `And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibraheem (Abraham) [or the stone on which 
Ibraheem (Abraham) stood while he was building the Ka'bah) as a place of prayer` (al Baqarah 2:125). And I said: Why don't you tell the Mothers of the Believers to observe hijab, for both righteous people and evildoers enter upon you? Then the verse of hijab was revealed. And I heard something about the Mothers of the Believers, so I talked to them and told them: You should stop bothering the Messenger of Allah ﷺ , or Allah will replace you with wives who are better than you and are Muslims. Then I came to one of the Mothers of the Believers and she said: O 'Umar, is it the case that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ cannot admonish his wives so that you come and admonish them? So I stopped, then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, revealed the verse: “It may be if he divorced you (all) that his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you Muslims (who submit to Allah), believers, obedient (to Allah)...` [at­-Tahreerm 66:5)";Musnad Ahmad 160, Book 2, Hadith 77;question #6;What lessons can be learned from the interactions between 'Umar and the Prophet regarding divine revelations?
"I have come from Koofah, O Ameer al-­Mu'mineen, and I left behind in it a man who dictates the Mushaf From memory. ‘Umar got exceedingly angry and said: Who is he, woe to you? He said: 'Abdullah bin Mas'ood. ‘Umar began to calm down, and went back to normal, then he said: Woe to you, I do not know of anyone who is more qualified to do that than him, and I will tell you about that. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to stay up at night talking with Abu Bakr  رضي الله عنه discussing some affairs of the Muslims. He stayed up talking with him one night, and I was with him. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ went out, and we went out with him, and we saw a man standing and praying in the mosque. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ listened to his recitation, and as soon as we recognised him the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: `Whoever would like to recite the Qur'an fresh as it was revealed, let him recite it according to the recitation of Ibn Umm 'Abd.` Then the same man sat and offered supplication (du'a') and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ started saying to him: `Ask, you will be given;ask, you will be given.” ‘Umar said: By Allah, I shall go to him tomorrow and tell hirm the glad tidings. I went to him the next morning to tell him the glad tidings, and I found that Abu Bakr had beaten me to it and given him the glad tidings. By Allah, I never competed with him to do good but he beat me to it.";Musnad Ahmad 175, Book 2, Hadith 92;question #6;What role did the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ play in encouraging his companions to seek and receive blessings from Allah?
"Umar addressed the people in al­-Jabiyah, and said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood as I am standing and said: `Treat my Companions kindly, then those who come after them, then those who come after them. Then there will come people who will swear oaths before being asked to swear and will give testimony before being asked to 
give testimony. Whoever among you would like to attain the best place in Paradise, let him adhere to the jama'ah (the main body of Muslims), for the Shaitan is with one and he is further away from two. No man should be alone with a woman because the Shaitan will be the third one present. Whoever feels pleased when he does a good deed and feels bad when he does an evil deed is a believer.”";Musnad Ahmad 177, Book 2, Hadith 94;question #6;How does the presence of Shaitan influence individuals when they are alone or in pairs?
"We were with 'Umar between Makkah and Madinah, and we looked for the new crescent moon. I was sharp sighted and I saw it, and I started saying to ‘Umar, Don't you see it? He said: I will see it when I am lying in my bed. Then he started telling us about the people of Badr. He said: the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was showing us the places where they would fall (in battle), saying: “This is where So and so will fall in battle tomorrow, if Allah wills; this is where So and so will fall in battle tomorrow, if Allah wills.” And they started to fall in those places, I said: By the One who sent you with the truth, they did not miss those places; they fell in those places. Then he ordered that they be thrown into a well, and he went to them and said: `O So and so, O So and so, did you find what Allah promised you to be true? For I found what Allah promised me to be true.` 'Umar said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) , are you speaking to people who are now dead? He said: `You do not hear what I am saying any better than they do, but they cannot answer.`";Musnad Ahmad 182, Book 2, Hadith 99;question #6;How did 'Umar respond to the Prophet's ﷺ actions and statements regarding the deceased at Badr?
"We met 'Abdullah bin 'Umar and discussed the divine decree (al qadar) and what others said concerning it. He said: When you go back to them, say; Ibn ‘Umar has nothing to do with you and you have nothing to do with him - three times. Then he said: ‘Umar bin al Khattab  رضي الله عنه ­­ told me that whilst they were sitting with the Prophet ﷺ ­, a man came to him walking, with a handsome face and hair, wearing white clothes. The people looked at one another (as if to say): We do not know this man and he does not look like a traveller. Then he said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) , shall I come to you? He said: `Yes.` So he came and put his knees against his knees and his hands on his thighs and said: What is Islam? He said: `To testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) , to establish regular prayer, to give zakah, to fast Ramadan and to go on pilgrimage to the House.` He said: What is faith (eeman)? He said: “To believe in Allah, His angels, Paradise and Hell, resurrection 
after death and the divine decree, all of it.” He said: What is ihsan? He said: `To strive for the sake of Allah as if you see Him, and even though you do not see Him, He sees you.` He said: When will the Hour come? He said: `The one who is asked about it does not know more than the one who is asking.” He 
said: What are its portents? He said: `When the destitute, barefoot, naked shepherds compete in constructing lofty buildings, and the slave women give birth to their masters.” Then he said: `Call the man to me.” They looked for him but they saw no trace of him. Two or three days passed, then he said: “O Ibn al­ Khattab, do you know who that was who asked about such and such?” He said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: `That was Jibreel who came to teach you your religion.` A man from Juhainah or Muzainah asked him: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) , what are we striving for? Is it something that is already decided or is it something that is evolving right now? He said:`For some-­thing that is already decided.` The man or one of the people said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) , then why should we strive? He said: “The people of Paradise will be enabled to do the deeds of the people of Paradise and the people of Hell will be enabled to do the deeds of the people of Hell.` Yahya said: And that is how it is.";Musnad Ahmad 184, Book 2, Hadith 101;question #6;What is the significance of Jibreel's visit in teaching the fundamentals of religion?
"I dreamt that a rooster pecked me twice, and I can only interpret it as meaning that my death is near, and there are 
people who are telling me I should appoint someone to be my successor, but Allah will not cause His religion and the caliphate, with which He sent His Prophet ﷺ, to be lost. If death comes to me soon, then the caliphate is to be decided by these six men with whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was pleased when he died. Whichever of them you swear allegiance to, then listen to him and obey. I know that some people will object to this matter. I have fought them with my own hands in the defence of Islam. If they do that, then they are the enemies of Allah and misguided kafirs. I am not leaving behind anything more important to me than kalalah. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ never emphasised any issue to me since I accompanied him more than the issue of kalalah, and I did not ask him about anything more than I asked him about kalalah, until he poked me in the chest with his finger and said: “O 'Umar, is not ayatus­-saif (the verse of summer, i.e. it was revealed in summer), which appears at the end of Soorat an-Nisa', sufficient for you?` If I live I will issue a decree that will be so clear that those who read the Qur'an and those who do not read it will be able to make decisions concerning it. Then he said. O Allah, I call upon You to bear witness over the governors of the regions, for I only sent them to teach the people their religion and the Sunnah of their Prophet and to the divide the fai' among them and to be just to them and to refer to me concerning any difficult matter, O people, you eat two plants which I find to be nothing but repugnant. I remember the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, if he noticed their smell coming from a man in the mosque, he would issue orders 
that he taken by the hand and led out to al­-Baqee', Whoever must eat them, let him cook them to death.`";Musnad Ahmad 186, Book 2, Hadith 103;question #6;How does Umar bin al Khattab view those who might object to the decision of the caliphate?
What is faith (eeman)? He said:“To believe in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day and the divine decree, both good and bad,” Jibreel said to him: You have spoken the truth. He said: We were amazed that he asked him and then confirmed his answers as being correct. The Prophet ﷺ said: “That was Jībreel, who came to teach you your religion.`;Musnad Ahmad 191, Book 2, Hadith 108;question #6;What role does Jibreel play in conveying religious teachings to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ?
I was with ‘Umar and a man came to him and said:I have seen the new moon, the new moon of Shawwal. 'Umar said: O people, break the fast. Then he went to a vessel in which there was water and did wudoo’, and he wiped over his khuffain. A man said: By Allah, O. Ameer al-Mu'mineen, I only came to you to ask about this. Did you see any one else do this? He said: Yes, one who was better than me and the best of the ummah. I saw Abul­-Qasim ﷺ do the same as I have done, when he was wearing a Syrian jubbah with tight sleeves, he put his hand under the jubbah. Then 'Umar prayed Maghrib.;Musnad Ahmad 193, Book 2, Hadith 110;question #6;How did 'Umar exemplify leadership in making decisions based on Islamic teachings?
Some people say: what is this stoning? ín the Book of Allah it mentions flogging.But the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stoned [adulterers] and we stoned [them] after him. Were it not that some people would say that 'Umar added something to the Book of Allah that is not part of it, I would have written it the way it was revealed.;Musnad Ahmad 197, Book 2, Hadith 114;question #6;How does the hadith address the potential for misunderstanding or misinterpretation of Islamic law?
"On the day of Badr, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) looked at his companions and they were three hundred and some, then he looked at the mushrikeen and saw that they were one thousand or more. The Prophet of Allah(ﷺ) turned to face the qiblah, then he stretched forth his hands, wearing his upper and lower garment, and he said: “O Allah, where is Your promise to me? O Allah, accomplish for me what You have promised me! O Allah, if this small band of Muslims is destroyed, You will never be worshipped on earth.” He kept beseeching his Lord, calling out to Him, until his upper garment fell from his shoulders. Abu Bakr came to him, picked up his upper garment and put it on him. Then he embraced him from behind and said: O Prophet of Allah, this prayer of yours to your Lord will suffice, for He will accomplish for you what He has promised to you. Then Allah revealed the words: `(Remember) when you sought help of your Lord and He answered you (saying): ‘I will help you with a thousand of the angels each behind the other (following one another) in succession` [al Anfal 8:9). On that day when the armies met (in battle), Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, defeated the mushrikeen; seventy of their men were killed and seventy were taken captive. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) consulted Abu Bakr, 'Ali and 'Umar رضي الله عنهم (concerning the prisoners). Abu Bakr said: O Prophet of Allah, they are our cousins, kinsmen and brothers, I think that you should accept a ransom for them, which will strengthen us against the kuffar, and perhaps Allah will guide them to Islam and they will become a support to us. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: “What do you think, O son of al-Khattab?` I said: No, by Allah. I do not think as Abu Bakr thinks. I think that you should hand. So and so ­ a relative of ʼUmar's- ­ over 
to me so that I may strike his neck. You should hand ‘Aqeel over to ‘Ali so that he may strike his neck, and you should hand over So and so to Hamzah (his brother) so that he may strike his neck, so that Allah will know that we have no mercy in our hearts towards the mushrikeen; these are 
their prominent figures and leaders. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  inclined towards the view of Abu Bakr, and he did not incline towards what I said, and accepted ransoms from them. The next day, I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and found him with Abu Bakr, and they were both weeping I said: O Messenger of Allah , tell me why you and your companion are weeping. If I find it is a cause for weeping, I will weep too, and is it is not, then I will make myself weep with you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `I am weeping because of what your companions suggested about accepting a ransom for the prisoners. I have been shown your punishment as close as this tree` ­ a tree that was close to the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) Then Allah revealed the words:`It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land. You desire the good of this world (i.e. the money of ransom for freeing the captives), but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter. And Allah is Almighty, All Wise. Were it not a previous ordainment from Allah, a severe torment would have touched you for what you took `[al Anfal 8:67­-68] ­ i.e., referring to the ransom. Then booty was permitted to them, and when the day of Uhud came the following year, they were punished for what they had done of taking the 
ransom on the day of Badr. Seventy of them were killed and the Companions of the Prophet deserted him, his front tooth was broken and the helmet on his head was broken, and blood flowed down his face, and Allah revealed the words: “When a single disaster smites you, although you smote (your enemies) with one twice as great, you say: 'From where does this come to us?`Say (to them), ‘It is from yourselves (because of your evil deeds).' And Allah has power over all things” [Al 'Imran 3:165]";Musnad Ahmad 208, Book 2, Hadith 125;question #6;What lessons were learned by the Muslims from the events following the Battle of Badr and the subsequent Battle of Uhud?
"We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  on a journey, and I asked him about something three times but he did not answer me. I said to myself, May 
your mother be bereft of you. O son of al-Khattab, you spoke to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) three times and he did not answer you. So I got on my mount and went on ahead, fearing that something had been revealed concerning me. Then I heard someone calling out: O 'Umar! Where is ‘Umar? I went back, thinking that something had been revealed concerning me, and the Prophet (ﷺ) said: `Yesterday a soorah was revealed to me that is dearer to me than this world and everything in it: ‘Verily, We have given you (O Muhammad ﷺ) a manifest victory. That Atlah may forgive you your sins of the past and the future' (al­-Fath 48:1–2].";Musnad Ahmad 209, Book 2, Hadith 126;question #6;What does this narration reveal about the process of revelation and its immediate effects on the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions?

"I was eager to ask 'Umar about the two wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) concerning whom Allah said, “If you two (wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) turn in repentance
to Allah, (it will be better for you), your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet (ﷺ) likes)” [at-Tahreem 66:4], until 'Umar went for Hajj and I went with him. When we were partway there, 'Umar turned aside and I turned aside with him, bringing the jug. He relieved himself, then he came to me and I poured water onto his hands, and he did wudoo’. I said: “O Ameer al -Mu'mineen, who are the two wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) of whom Allah said: ‘If you two (wives of the Prophet (ﷺ)) turn in repentance to Allah, (it will be better for you), your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet (ﷺ) likes)’?” [at-Tahreem 66:4] 'Umar said, “How strange of you, O Ibn  'Abbas”, (az-Zuhri said: By Allah, he did not like the question, but he did not conceal anything.) He said, “They were Hafsah and 'A'ishah.” Then he started to narrate the hadeeth and said: We people of Quraish were a people who dominated women, but when we came to Madinah we found a people who were dominated by their women, and our women started to learn from their women. My house was among Banu Umayyah bin Zaid in al-'Awali. One day I got angry with my wife, and she argued with me. I did not like her to argue with me, but she said: Do you not like me to argue with you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) argue with him, and one of them will forsake him all day until night comes, I went and entered upon Hafsah, and I said: Do
you argue with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? She said: Yes. I said: Does one of you forsake him all day until night comes? She said: Yes. I said: Any one of you who does that is doomed and lost. Does any one of you feel assured that Allah will not be angry with her because of the anger of His
Messenger (ﷺ), for then she will be doomed? Do not argue with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and do not ask him for anything. Ask me for whatever you want. And do not be misled by the fact that your neighbour is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) than
you – referring to 'A'ishah. And ‘Umar said: I had a neighbour among the Ansar. We used to take turns to go down to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He would go down one day and I would go down the next. He would bring me the news of the Revelation and other things, and I would do likewise.
We were saying that Ghassan were shoeing their horses to attack us. My friend went down, then he came to me at night and knocked on my door, then he called out to me. I went out to him and he said: Something terrible has happened! I said: What? Have Ghassan come? He said: No, it is more terrible than that and worse. The Prophet (ﷺ) has divorced his wives! I said: Hafsah is doomed and lost! I thought that this would happen. Then when I had prayed Fajr, I got dressed, then I went down and entered upon Hafsah, who was weeping. I said: Has the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)divorced you? She said: I do not know. He has secluded himself in this loft. I went to a black slave of his and said: Ask for permission for ‘Umar to enter. He went in, then he came out to me and said: I mentioned you to him but he did not say anything, I went away and came to the minbar, where I sat down. By it was a group of people, some of whom were weeping. I sat for a little while, then I could not bear it any longer, so I went to the slave and said: Ask for permission for ‘Umar to enter. He went in, then he came out to me and said: I mentioned you to him but he did not say anything. I turned to leave, then the slave called me and said: Go in, he has given you permission. So I went in and greeted the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with salam. He was resting on a reed mat that had left marks on his side. I said: O Messenger of Allah, have you divorced your wives? He looked up at me and said, “No.” I said: Allah Akbar! if you had seen us, O Messenger of Allah, we Quraish were a people who dominated women, but when we came to Madinah we found a people who were dominated by their women, and our women started to learn from their women. I got angry with my wife one day, and she started to argue with me. I did not like her to argue with me, but she said: Do you not like me to argue with you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) argue with him, and one of them will forsake him all day until night comes. I said: Any one of them who does that is doomed and lost. Does one of them feel assured that Allah will not be angry with her because of the anger of His Messenger (ﷺ),then she will be doomed? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled. I said: O Messenger of Allah, I entered upon Hafsah and I said: Do not be misled by the fact that your neighbour (i.e. ‘Aa'ishah) is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) than you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled again. I said: O Messenger of Allah, may I speak to you freely? He said: “Yes.” So I sat down and looked around the room, and by Allah, I did not see anything in it to please the eye except three hides. I said: Pray to Allah, O Messenger of Allah, to make life prosperous for your ummah, for He has made life prosperous for the Persians and Romans, but they do not worship Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. He sat up straight and said: “Are you doubting. O son of al-Khattab? They are people whose good things have been hastened for them in this world.” I said: Pray for forgiveness for me, O Messenger of Allah. He had sworn that he would not enter upon them for a month, because he was so annoyed with them until Allah rebuked him.";Musnad Ahmad 222, Book 2, Hadith 139;question #6;What was the significance of the Prophet's seclusion from his wives for a month?
l heard 'Umar bin al-Khattab say: When the Revelation came down to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), a sound could be heard near his face like the buzzing of bees. We waited a while, then he turned to face the qiblah and raised his hands, then he said: “O Allah, give us more (blessing) and do not give us less; honour us and do not humiliate us, give to us and do not deprive us, give precedence to us and do not give others precedence over us; be pleased with us and make us pleased.” Then he said: “Ten verses have been revealed to me; whoever adheres to thern will enter Paradise.” Then he recited to us: “Successful indeed are the believers” [al-Mu'minoon 23:1] until he completed the ten verses.;Musnad Ahmad 223, Book 2, Hadith 140;question #6;What are the themes of the supplications made by the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) in this narration?
Whom have you appointed as your deputy over the people of the valley? He said: I have appointed Ibn Abza over them, ‘Umar said: Who is Ibn Abza? Nafiʼ said: One of our freed slaves. ‘Umar said: Have you appointed a freed slave over them? Nafi’ said: He has great knowledge of the Book of Allah, is well versed in the rules of inheritance (al­-fara'id) and is a (good) qadi (judge). 'Umar said. Indeed your Prophet (ﷺ) said, “Allah raises some people (in status) by means of this Book and brings others low by means of it.”;Musnad Ahmad 232, Book 2, Hadith 148;question #6;What role does the ability to judge fairly play in the selection of leaders in Islam?
When the apostates apostatised at the time of Abu Bakr, ‘Umar said: How can you fight the people, O Abu Bakr, when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “I have been commanded to fight the people until they say La ilaha illallah (There is no god but Allah), and whoever says La ilaha illallah, his wealth and his life are protected from me except in cases dictated by Islamic law, and his reckoning will be with Allah`? Abu Bakr said: By Allah, I will most certainly fight those who separate prayer and zakah, for zakah is what is due on wealth. By Allah, if they withhold from me a small she-goat that they used to give to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I will certainly fight them for withholding it. `Umar bin al-Khattab said. By Allah, as soon as I saw that Allah had opened Abu Bakr`s heart to the idea of fighting, I knew that he was right.;Musnad Ahmad 239, Book 2, Hadith 154;question #6;What role did divine guidance play in Abu Bakr's decision-making process according to Umar ibn al-Khattab?
"`Umar said: My opinion coincided with that of my Lord in three matters and my Lord confirmed my opinion in three matters. I said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), why don`t you take Maqam Ibraheem as a place of prayer? Then Allah revealed the words: “And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibraheem (Abraham) [or the stone on which Ibraheem (Abraham) to stood while he was building the Ka`bah] as a place of prayer” [al-Baqarah 2:125]. And I said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), both righteous and immoral people enter upon you; why don`t you tell the Mothers of the Believers to observe hijab? Then Allah revealed the verse of hijab. And I heard that the Prophet (ﷺ) had rebuked some of his wives, so I sought permission to speak to the Mothers of the Believers, then I entered upon them and said to each one of them: By Allah, either you stop, or Allah will give His Messenger (wives) who are better than you. I went to one of his wives and she said: O ‘Umar, don`t you think that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is able to exhort his wives? Why are you exhorting them? Then Allah revealed the words. It may be if he divorced you (all) that his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you` [at-Tahreem 66:5]";Musnad Ahmad 250, Book 2, Hadith 164;question #6;What does the hadith imply about the potential consequences for the Prophet's wives if they did not heed the warnings?
"When the people of Yemen came, ‘Umar started asking people in the group, Is there anyone among you from Qaran, until he came to [the tribe of Qaran] and said: Who are you? They said: Qaran. Umar’s reins - or Uwais`s reins - fell and one of them picked them up and gave them to the other. ‘Umar recognized him and said: What is your name? He said: I am Uwais, [ʼUmar] said: Do you have a mother? [Uwais] said: Yes. [ʻUmar] said: Did you have any whiteness [leprosy]? He said: Yes, but I prayed to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and He took it away, except for an area the size of a dirham near my navel, so that I would remember my Lord. ‘Umar said to him: Pray for forgiveness for me. He said: Rather you should pray for forgiveness for me; you are the Companion of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). ʼUmar (e.) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: `The best of the Tabi`een will be a man called Uwais who has a mother, and he has some whiteness, then he prayed to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and He took it away, except for an area the size of a dirham near his navel.” So he prayed for forgiveness for him, then he disappeared in a group of people and no one knew where he ended up. Then he (Uwais) came to Koofah. We used to gather in a circle, remembering Allah, and he would sit with us, and when he spoke of Allah, his words would have an impact on us like that of no one else. And he quoted the hadeeth...It was narrated from Qais or Ibn Qais, a man from Ju`fi, from `Umar bin al-Khattab and he mentioned a Hadeeth similar to that of Affan.";Musnad Ahmad 266, 267, Book 2, Hadith 180;question #6;How did Uwais's presence and actions influence the people of Koofah?
I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when he was in al-Batha` and he said: `What did you enter ihram for?` I said: I have entered ihram for the same as the Prophet (ﷺ) did. He said: `Have you brought a sacrificial animal?` I said: No. He said: “Circumambulate the House and go between as-Safa and al-Marwah, then exit ihraam.” So I circumambulated the House and went between as-Safa and al-Marwah, then I went to a woman of my people and she combed my hair and washed my head. I used to give fatwas on that basis during the caliphate of Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. During one season when I was performing Hajj, a man came to me and said: You do not know the latest fatwa of Ameer al-Mu`mineen concerning the Hajj. I said: O people, if we gave a fatwa, Ameer al-Mu`mineen is coming to you, so follow him in performing Hajj. When he came I said: What is this thing that you have introduced to the rituals [of Hajj]? He said: We see in the Book of Allah that Allah, may He be exalted, says: `And perform properly (i.e. all the ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), the Hajj and ‘Umrah (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allah` [al-Baqarah 2:196], and if we follow the Sunnah of our Prophet (ﷺ), he did not exit ihraam until he offered the sacrifice.;Musnad Ahmad 273, Book 2, Hadith 185;question #6;How did the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) handle changes in religious rulings during their time?
"I heard ‘Umar say: Do not make women`s dowries expensive, do not make women`s dowries expensive, for had this been a sign of honour in this world or piety before Allah, the first one of you to do it would have been the Prophet (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not give any of his wives, and none of his daughters were given, any more than twelve Oasiyyahs [as a dowry. And a man will go to great trouble in order to offer a high dowry to his wife.
On one occasion he said: A man would pay his wife a high dowry until he feels resentment towards her and says: You cost me everything I own, even the string to tie a waterskin and hang it up. He [the narrator] said: I was a young Arab boy with a non-Arab mother, and I did not know what a `string` was. `Umar said: And another thing you say of one who is killed in your campaigns and dies that so and so was killed as a martyr, and o and so died as a martyr. But perhaps he loaded the back of his mount with gold and silver for the purpose of trading. So do not say that, rather say what the Prophet (ﷺ) (or what Muhammad) (ﷺ) said: “Whoever is killed or dies for the sake of Allah will be in Paradise.`";Musnad Ahmad 285, Book 2, Hadith 195;question #6;What lessons can be learned from 'Umar's advice regarding dowries and martyrdom?
"`Umar bin al-Khattab gave a speech and said: O people, we used to know you when the Prophet (ﷺ) was among us and revelation was coming down to him; Allah would tell us about you. But now the Prophet (ﷺ) has passed away and revelation has ceased, and now the way to judge you is this whoever among you shows us good conduct, we will think well of him and love him; whoever among you shows us bad conduct, we will think badly of him and hate him for that, and whatever is in your hearts is between you and your Lord. There was a time when I used to think that whoever learned the Qur`an, seeking thereby Allah and (the reward that) is with Him, would be rewarded in the Hereafter, but some men learned Qur`an seeking that which is with people. So seek Allah by learning Qur`an and by your good deeds. By Allah, I do not send my workers to strike you or seize your wealth; rather I send them to you to teach you your religion and Sunnah, whoever has done to him something other than that, let him refer it to me, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, I shall surely grant him retaliation. `Amr bin al-`As stood up and said: O Ameer al Mu`mineen, do you think if one of the Muslims was in charge of some people and he disciplined one of them, would you allow that one to settle the score with him? He said: Yes, by the One in Whose hand is the soul of `Umar, I would not certainly allow him to settle the score with him. I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) do that with regard to himself. But do not strike the Muslims and thus humiliate them, and do not keep them away from their wives on campaign for too long and thus expose them to temptation. Do not withhold from them their due rights and cause them to rebel; and do not make them camp in an area with a lot of trees, because that will cause them to be scattered.It was narrated that ‘Abul-`Ajfa` as-Sulami said: I heard ‘Umar say: Do not make women`s dowries expensive,... and he mentioned the same hadeeth.";Musnad Ahmad 286, 287, Book 2, Hadith 196;question #6;What are the potential consequences of leaders mistreating their subjects or withholding their rights?
"I was sitting beside Ibn ‘Umar, and we were waiting for the funeral of Umm Aban bint `Uthman bin `Affan. `Amr bin `Uthman was also present. Ibn ‘Abbas came, led by a guide, who told him where Ibn ‘Umar was. He came and sat beside me, so I was between them, and we heard a voice from inside the house, Ibn `Umar said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: `The deceased is tormented because of the crying of his family.` He said: And `Abdullah understood it as general in meaning. Ibn `Abbas said: We were with Ameer al-Muʼmineen ‘Umar until we came to some arid land, where we found a man who had halted in the shade of a tree. He said to me: Go and find out for me who that man is, I went and found that it was Suhaib. I came back to him and said: You told me to find out for you who that man is; it is Suhaib. He said: Tell him to join us. I said: He has his family with him. He said: Even if he has his family with him [and perhaps Ayyoob said on one occasion:Tell him to join us). When we came to Madinah, it was not long before Ameer al Muʼmineen [ʼUmar} was attacked. Suhaib came, saying O my brother, O my friend! `Umar said: Do you not know, or have you not heard, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `The deceased is tormented because of some of his family`s crying.” “Abdullah understood it as general in meaning, but ‘Umar said: some of [their] weeping. I went to `A`ishah, and I told her what Ibn `Umar had said. She said: No, by Allah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not say, “The deceased is tormented because of the weeping of anyone.” Rather he said: “Allah increases the torment of the kafir because of his family`s weeping, and that it is He (Allah) Who makes (whom He wills) laugh, and makes (whom He wills) weep, “And no bearer of burdens shall bear another`s burden` [Al Anʼam 6:164].” Ayyoob said: Ibn Abu Mulaikah said: al-Qasim bin Muhammad told me: When `Aʼishah heard what ʼUmar and Ibn `Umar had said, she said. You are narrating to me from two who are not liars and are not to be suspected of being liars, but one may mishear.`Abdullah bin Abi Mulaikah narrated… and he mentioned a hadeeth similar to that of Ayyoob, except that he said: ibn `Umar said to `Amr bin `Uthman, when he was facing him: Why don`t you tell them not to weep? For the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `The deceased is tormented because of his family`s weeping for him.`";Musnad Ahmad 288, 289, Book 2, Hadith 197;question #6;How does the concept of individual responsibility relate to the actions of family members in Islamic teachings?
"`Umar would swear an oath three times, saying: By Allah, no one has more right to this wealth than anyone else, I have no more right to it than anyone else; there is no Muslim who does not have a share in this wealth, except a slave, but it is to be divided according to our categories in the light of the Book of Allah and our closeness to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Thus it is to be given on the basis of a man`s efforts for the sake of lslam, his seniority in Islam, his support for Islam, and his need. By Allah, if I live, a shepherd in the mountains of San‘a’ will get his share of that wealth when he is tending his flock.";Musnad Ahmad 292, Book 2, Hadith 200;question #6;How does the concept of equality manifest in the distribution of wealth among Muslims?
"I heard `Abdullah bin `Umar say: `Umar said: Send me a doctor to examine this wound of mine. So they sent for an Arab doctor who gave ʼUmar nabeedh, and the nabeedh was mixed with blood when it came out of the stab wound that was beneath his navel. I [Ibn ‘Umar) called another doctor from among the Ansar, from the tribe of Banu Mu`awiyah. He gave him milk to drink and it came out of the wound solid and white, The doctor said to him: O Ameer al Mu’mineen, give your final instructions, `Umar said: The man from Banu Mu`awiyah has spoken the truth. If you had said anything else I would not have believed you. The people wept for him when they heard that, but he said: Do not weep for us; whoever wants to weep, let him leave. Did you not hear what the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said? He said: `The deceased is tormented by his family`s weeping for him.` Because of that, `Abdullah did not approve of any weeping if one of his sons or anyone else died.";Musnad Ahmad 294, Book 2, Hadith 202;question #6;How does the hadith illustrate the importance of verifying information before accepting it as truth?
I passed by Hisham bin Hakeem bin Hizam when he was reciting Sooratal-Furqan during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I listened to his recitation and he was reciting in a manner different from the way in which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had taught me to recite it. I was about to interrupt him whilst he was praying, but I waited until he finished his prayer, and then I tied his garment around his neck. I said to him: Who taught you this soorah that you are reciting? He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) taught it to me. I said to him: You are lying by Allah! He taught me this soorah that you recited. I brought him to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said, `O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I heard this man reciting Sooratal-Furqan in a way different to the way you taught it to me, and you taught me Sooratal-Furqan, The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Let him go, O `Umar: Recite it, O Hisham. So he recited it to him as I had heard him recite it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, `Thus it was revealed.` Then he said to me, `Recite it,” so I recited it and he said, “Thus it was revealed.` Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is said: `This Qur`an has been revealed in seven different ways, so recite it in the way that is easiest for you.”It was narrated from al Miswar bin Makhramah and `Abdur-Rahman bin Abdul-Qari that  they heard Umar bin al Khattab say: I passed by Hisham bin Hakeem bin Hizam when he was reciting Sooratal-Furqan during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I listened to his recitation and he was reciting in a way different from the way in which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had taught me to recite it. I was about to interrupt him whilst he was praying, but I waited until he said the tasleem, and when he had said the tasleem,... and he narrated a similar report.;Musnad Ahmad 296, 297, Book 2, Hadith 204;question #6;How does this narration illustrate the process of verifying Qur'anic recitation during the Prophet's time?
"Wear izars and rida`s and wear shoes, but take off boots and pants; throw away the stirrups and jump onto your mounts. You should wear rough clothes and practise archery, and keep away from luxury and the dress of the non-Arabs, Beware of silk, for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade it and said: `Do not wear silk except this much` - and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gestured with two fingers.";Musnad Ahmad 301, Book 2, Hadith 208;question #6;What is the importance of simplicity and avoiding luxury in Islamic lifestyle?
"Learn from me three things, for I fear that the people will not come to me (before I die). As for me, I did not pass any judgement regarding kalalah and I did not appoint any successor to be in charge of the people after me, and every slave of his [Umar`s] will be free. The people said to him: Appoint a successor. He said: Whatever I do, it was done by someone better than me. If I leave the people to decide their affairs, the Prophet (ﷺ) of Allah did that, and if I appoint someone, one who is better than me did that, namely Abu Bakr, I said to him: Receive the glad tidings of Paradise; you accompanied the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), your companionship with him was long; you were appointed in charge of the believers and you showed strength and fulfilled the trust. He said. As for your glad tidings to me of Paradise - `Affan [another narrator] said: No by Allah besides Whom there is no god- if I had the entire world and all that is in it, I would give it as a ransom from the terror of what lies before me, even before knowing the outcome. As for what you say about me being in charge of the believers` affairs, by Allah I wish that I could get out of it without gaining or losing anything. As for what you said about me accompanying the Prophet (ﷺ) of Allah, that is true.";Musnad Ahmad 322, Book 2, Hadith 228;question #6;What does the hadith suggest about the criteria for appointing a successor in Islamic governance?
When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died and some people apostatised, ‘Umar bin al-Khattab said: O Abu Bakr, how can you fight the people, when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “I have been commanded to fight the people until they say La ilaha illallah (There is no god but Allah), and whoever says La ilaha illallah, his wealth and his life are protected from me, and his reckoning will be with Allah`? Abu Bakr said: I will most certainly fight those who separate prayer and zakah, for zakah is what is due on wealth. By Allah, if they withhold from me a small she-goat that they used to give to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I will certainly fight them for withholding it. ʻUmar said: By Allah, as soon as I saw that Allah had opened Abu Bakr`s heart to the idea of fighting I knew that he was right.;Musnad Ahmad 335, Book 2, Hadith 241;question #6;How did Umar bin al-Khattab's perspective change regarding Abu Bakr's decision to fight, and what influenced this change?
"`I have seen a dream, in which I saw myself being pecked by a rooster twice, and I think it signals my death. The people are telling me to appoint a caliph after me. Allah will not cause His caliphate or His religion to be lost, or that with which He sent His Prophet (ﷺ). If I die, then the caliphate is to be decided by a council of these six men with whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was pleased when he died, then whichever of them you swear allegiance to, listen to him and obey. I know that there are some men then who will seek to undermine this matter, and I have sought them with these two hands of mine in support of Islam. It they do that, then those are the enemies of Allah, the misguided disbelievers. By Allah, I am not leaving behind anything of more concern to me than kalalah. I asked the Prophet (ﷺ) of Allah  about it and he never spoke to me in such a harsh manner as he did with regard to that, to such an extent that he poked me in the chest or side with his hand or his finger and said: `O `Umar: The verse at the end of Soorah an Nisa’ that was revealed in summer is sufficient for you.” If I live, I will pass a judgement concerning it that no one who reads Qur`an or who does not read Qur`an will dispute. Then `Umar said: O Allah, bear witness concerning the governors of the regions; I sent them to teach the people their religion and the Sunnah of their Prophet (ﷺ), and to divide the sai` among them, and to judge between them on a fair basis, and whatever they found difficult they were to refer to me. Then he said: O people, you eat two plants that I think are nothing but distasteful, this garlic and onion. At the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I would see that is the smell of these things was found on a man, he would be taken by the hand and led out to al-Baqee`. Whoever must eat them, let him cook them to death.ʻUmar said this in a khutbah on Friday, and was stabbed on Wednesday 26 Dhul Hijjah.";Musnad Ahmad 341, Book 2, Hadith 247;question #6;How did `Umar ensure the governors were fulfilling their duties in teaching religion and administering justice?
"I heard ‘Iyad al-Ash`ari say: i was present at al-Yarmouk and we had five commanders over us: Abu `Ubaidah bin al-Jarrah, Yazeed bin Abi Sufyan, Ibn Hasanah, Khalid bin al-Waleed and `Iyad - and this `Iyad was not the one who narrated reports to Simak. - `Umar (رضي الله عنه) said: If fighting occurs, then your commander is Abu `Ubaidah. So we wrote to him, saying: We are facing death; and we asked him for reinforcements. He wrote to us, saying: I have received your letter asking for reinforcements and I can tell you about who has the greatest support and the most ready troops.
Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, ask Him for support, for Muhammad (ﷺ) was caused to prevail on the day of Badr with fewer than your numbers. When this letter of mine reaches you, fight them without referring back to me. So we fought them, and we defeated them, pursuing and killing them for four parasangs, and we acquired wealth (booly). They discussed the issue (of booty) and ‘Iyad suggested to us that we should give ten for every head. And Abu ʼUbaidah said: Who will compete with me (in a horse race)? A young man said: I will, if you don`t get angry. Then he beat him, and I saw the two braids of Abu ‘Ubaidah flying as he raced behind him on an Arabian horse.";Musnad Ahmad 344, Book 2, Hadith 250;question #6;How does the historical context of the Battle of Badr serve as a source of inspiration for Muslims facing adversity?
"I did Haji and I came to Madinah the year ‘Umar was stabbed. He gave a speech and said: I dreamt that a red rooster pecked me once or twice-Shu`bah was riot certain - and what happened was that he was stabbed. The people were given permission to enter upon him. The first ones to enter upon him were the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ), then the people of Madinah, then the people of Syria. Then permission was given to the people of Iraq, and I was among those who entered upon him. Every time people entered upon him, they praised him and wept. When we entered upon him, he had wrapped his stomach with a black turban cloth, and blood was flowing. We said: Give us some advice; and no one asked him for advice except us. Ile said: You have to adhere to the Book of Allah, for you will never go astray so long as you follow it. We said: Advise u5. He said: I urge you to be kind to the Muhajireen, for the people will increase in number and they will decrease. And I advise you to be kind to the Ansar, for they are the people of Islam with whom Islam sought refuge. And I advise you to be kind to the Bedouin, for they are your origin and your strength. And I advise you be kind to the non-Muslim people under your rule (ahludh-dhimmah), for they have a covenant with your Prophet (ﷺ) and they give you a source of income. You may leave now. And he did not say any more to us than these words. Muhammad bin Ja`far said: Shu’bah said: Then after that I asked him and he said concerning the Bedouin. I advise you to be kind to the Bedouin, for they are your brothers and the enemy of your enemy.It was narrated that Juwairiyyah bin Qudamah said:  I did Haji and I came to Madinah the year ‘Umar was stabbed. He gave a speech and said: I dreamt that a red rooster pecked me once or twice - Shu`bah was not certain - and only a week later, he was stabbed. And he mentioned a similar report, except that he said: And l advise you be kind to the non-Muslim people under your rule (ahludh-dhimmah), and honour the covenant of your Prophet (ﷺ). Then I asked him after that and he said concerning the Bedouin: I advise you to be kind to the Bedouin, for they are your brothers and the enemy of your enemy,";Musnad Ahmad 362, 363, Book 2, Hadith 266;question #6;What advice did Umar give to the people of Iraq when they visited him?
ʼUmar bin al-Khattab (رضي الله عنه) told me: Whilst we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) one day, a man came to us whose garment was exceedingly white and whose hair was exceedingly black, and we did not see any signs of travel on him, and none of us knew who he was. He came and sat before the Prophet (ﷺ), resting his knees against his and placing his hands on his thighs. He said: O Muhammad, tell me about Islam: what is Islam? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: `Islam means to bear witness that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), to establish regular prayer, to pay zakali, to fast Ramadan and to perform pilgrimage to the House (the Ka`bah), if you have the means.` He said: You have spoken the truth. He (‘Umar) said: It amazed us, how he questioned him and said that he had spoken the truth. He said: Tell me about faith (Eeman). He said: `Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in al-qadar (the divine will and decree), both good and bad.` He said: You have spoken the truth. He said: Tell me about ihsan: what is ilisan? - Yazeed said: - `It is to worship Allah as if you can see Him, for although you cannot see Ilim, He sees you.` He said: Tell me about the Hour. He said: “The one who is asked about it does not know more than the one who is asking.” He said: Then tell me about its signs. Ise said: `When the slave woman gives birth to her mistress, and when you see the barefoot, naked, destitute shepherds competing in the construction of lofty buildings.” He [Umar] said: Then he went away. He sumar waited for a while - Yazeed said: three (days). Then he (the Prophet (ﷺ) said to me: `O`Umar, do you know who that questioner was?` I said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: “That was Jibreel, who came to you to teach you your religion.`Ibn ‘Umar said. `Umar (رضي الله عنه) told us: We were sitting with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he mentioned the same hadeeth, except that he said: No signs of travel were to be seen on him. And he- said: `Umar said: 1 waited for three (days), then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “oʻUmar...”;Musnad Ahmad 367, 368, Book 2, Hadith 270;question #6;How does this narration illustrate the interaction between the Prophet (ﷺ) and Jibreel (Gabriel)?
l said to Ibn `Umar. We travel to different countries and we meet people who say there is no qadar (divine decree), Ibn `Umar said: If you meet them, tell them that `Abdullah bin `Umar has nothing to do with them and they have nothing to do with him-three times. Then he started narrating Whilst we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) , there came a man... and he described his appearance, The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Come closer, so he came closer. He said: Come closer, so he came closer. He said: Come closer, so he came closer, until his knees were nearly touching [the Prophet (ﷺ)`s] knees. Then he said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), tell me what is faith [or about faith]. He said: “To believe in Allah. His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in al-qadar.` - Sufyan said: I think he said: `... both good and bad.` He said: What is Islam? He said: “To establish prayer, pay zakah, perform pilgrimage to the House, to fast Ramadan and to do ghusl in the case of janabah.` For all of that, he [the stranger] said: You are right, you are right. The people said: We never saw any man show more respect to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) than this man did. It was as if he was teaching the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) . Then he said: O Messenger of Allah, tell me about ihsan.He said: “It is to worship Allah as if you see Him, for even if you do not see Him. He sees you.` For all of that we said: We never saw any man show more respect to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  than this man did, he said: You are right, you are right. He said: Tell me about the Hour. He said: “The one who is asked about it does not know more about it than one who is asking.` He said: You are right. He said it several times, and we never saw any man show more respect to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) than this man did. Then he left. Sufyan said: I heard that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Look for him,” but they did not find him. IIe said: `That was Jihree who came to you to teach you your religion. He never came to me in any form but I recognised him, except for this form.”It was narrated that Ibn Ya’mar said: I asked Ibn `Umar-or a man asked him: We travel in this land and we meet people who say, There is no qadar (divine decree), Ibn `Umar said: If you meet those people, tell them that ‘Abdullah bin `Umar has nothing to do with them and they have nothing to do with him - he said it three times. Then he told us. Whilst we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), a man came and said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), may I draw closer? He said: `Come closer.` So he came a little closer, then he said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), may I come closer? He said: `Come closer.” So he came a little closer, then he said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), may I come closer? He said: `Come closer.” So he came a little closer until his knees were almost touching the knees of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) . Then he said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), what is faith? - and he mentioned a similar report.;Musnad Ahmad 374, 375, Book 2, Hadith 276;question #6;How does this narration illustrate the role of Jibreel in teaching the religion of Islam?
Before the prohibition of khamr was revealed, ‘Umar said: O Allah, give us a clear ruling on khamr. Then the verse which is in Soorat al Baqarah was revealed: `They ask you (O Muhammad (ﷺ) concerning alcoholic drink and gambling. Say: “In them is a great sin...” [al-Baqarah 2:219]. `Umar was summoned and it was recited to him. He said: O Allah, give us a clear ruling on khamr, and the verse which is in Soorat an-Nisa` was revealed: “O you who believe Approach not As-Salah (the prayer) when you are in a drunken state.` [an-Nisa 4:43). When the Iqamah for prayer was given, the caller of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  would call out: Do not approach the prayer drunk, ‘Umar was summoned and it was recited to him. He said: O Allah, give us a clear ruling on khamr, and this verse was revealed then Umar was summoned and recited to hirn when he reached `So, will you not then abstain?` |al-Ma`idah 5:91]. Then `Umar said: We abstain, we abstain.;Musnad Ahmad 378, Book 2, Hadith 279;question #6;How did Umar bin al-Khattab respond to the final revelation concerning abstaining from alcohol?
And diseases of the heart means dying. Wakee said: And turmoil (fitnah) from which he has not repented.;Musnad Ahmad 388, Book 2, Hadith 289;question #6;Why might the Prophet (ﷺ) have included feebleness of old age in his supplications for protection?
`Umar (رضي الله عنه) sat where the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  used to sit, in a place where funerals passed by. A funeral passed by and they said good things (about the deceased). He said:lt is due, Then another funeral passed by and they said good things (about the deceased). He said: It is due. Then another funeral passed by and they said good things (about the deceased). He said: It is due, Then another funeral passed by and they said: This man was the most dishonest of people. He said: The most dishonest of people is the one who tells the most lies about Allah, and the next worst is the one who is dishonest with his soul in his body. They said: What do you think if four people testify? He said: It is due. They said: Or three? He said: If they are three, it is due. They said: Or two? He said: It is due, and if I had asked about one, that would have been dearer to me than red camels. It was said to ‘Umar: Is this something that you are saying on the basis of your own opinion or is it something that you heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) He said: No, rather it is something that I heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ);Musnad Ahmad 389, Book 2, Hadith 290;question #6;How does the opinion of the community affect the judgment of a person's life in Islamic tradition?
`Umar (رضي الله عنه) heard that when Sa`d built the palace, he said. Now there will be no more noise. ‘Umar sent Muhammad bin Maslamah to him, and when he arrived he took out some kindling and lit a fire, and he bought some wood for a dirham. It was said to Sa`d: A man has done such and such. He said: That is Muhammad bin Maslamah. He went out to him and swore by Allah that he never said that. He said: We will convey from you what you have said and we will do as we were instructed. So he burned the door. Then he [Sa`d] offered some supplies (to the envoy) but he refused. He left at midday and went to ‘Umar(رضي الله عنه), and he went and came back within nineteen days. He said: Were it not that I think well of you, I would have thought that you did not convey my message. He said: Yes I did convey it, he conveys his salam and apologises, and he swore by Allah that he did not say that. He said: Did he give you any provisions? He said: No. He said: What prevented you from supplying (sufficient, provisions to me yourself? He said: I did not want to instruct that you be given the cold whilst I had the hot [i.e., I could not have given you what you wanted of food and enjoyed plentiful food myself, when around me are the people of Madinah who are starving, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  say: `No man should eat his fill when his neighbour is going without.”;Musnad Ahmad 390, Book 2, Hadith 291;question #6;How did ‘Umar verify the message conveyed by Muhammad bin Maslamah?
"I used to recite to ‘AbdurRahman bin ‘Awf, and he found me waiting for him. That was in Mina during the last Hajj performed by `Umar bin al-Khattab (رضي الله عنه) Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf said: A man came to `Umar bin al-Khattab and said: So and so is saying: If `Umar (رضي الله عنه) dies, I will swear allegiance to So and so. ʼUmar (رضي الله عنه) said: I will stand before the people today and warn them against these people who want to deprive them of their rights, `Abdur-Rahman said: I said: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, do not do that, for the Hajj season brings together the riffraff and rabble among the people, and most of the people who gather around and listen to you will be of that type. Is you stand before the people, I am afraid that you will say something that they will spread and not understand it properly or interpret it properly. Rather wait until you come to Madinah, for it is the land of Hijrah and the Sunnah, and you will meet the most knowledgeable and noble people there, and you can say what you want to say with confidence; they wilt understand what you say and will interpret it correctly, `Umar (رضي الله عنه) said: If I reach Madinah safe and sound, I shall certainly talk to the people there in the first speech I deliver. When we came to Madinah at the end of Dhul-I-Iijah, it was a Friday. I set out early, ‘Umar did not care at what time he went out, because he did not pay attention to heat and cold and so on. I found Sa`eed bin Zaid at the right-hand corner of the minbar, he had got there before me. I sat down next to him, with my knee touching his knee, and it was not long before `Umar (رضي الله عنه)came. When I saw him, I said: He will certainly speak today on this minbar and say something that no one ever heard before. Sa`eed bin Zaid objected to that and said: What do you think he will say that no one said before? `Umar (رضي الله عنه)sat on the minbar, and when the mu`dhdhin fell silent, he stood up and praised and glorified Allah as He deserves, then he said: To proceed o people, I am going to tell you something that it has been decreed I should say. I do not know, perhaps it may signal my death. So whoever understands it and remembers it, let him narrate it to others wherever his mount takes him; whoever does not understand il, it is not permissible for him to tell lies about me. Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, sent Muhammad (ﷺ) with the truth and revealed the Book to him; among the things that were revealed to him was the verse of stoning [adulterers). We read it and understood it; the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stoned [adulterers] and we stoned adulterers] after him. But I fear that with the passage of time, some people will say: We do not find the verse of stoning in the Book of Allah, thus they will go astray by forsaking an  obligation that Allah revealed. Stoning is the due punishment in the Book of Allah for those who commit zina, both men and women, if they have been married and if proof is established, or there is a pregnancy or a confession, And we used to recite: Do not claim to be the offspring of anyone other than your fathers, as it is disbelief (or ingratitude) on your part to claim to be the offspring of anyone other than your fathers, Verily the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Do not praise me excessively as `Eesa, the son of Maryam, was praised; rather I am the slave of Allah, so say, the slave of Allah and His Messenger.` I have heard that some among you are saying. If `Umar (رضي الله عنه) dies, I shall swear allegiance to So and so. No man should deceive himself by saying that the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was is successful. There is no doubt that this is the case, but Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, saved the to 2 people from its bad consequences and there is no one among you today who has the qualities of Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) What happened to us when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died was that ‘Ali, az-Zubair and those who were with them stayed behind in the house of Fatimah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and all the Ansar stayed behind and gathered in Saqeefat Banu Sa`idah, whilst the Muhajireen gathered around Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) I said to him; O Abu Bakr, let us go to our brothers, the Ansar. So we set out, looking for them, then we were met by two righteous men who told us what the people had done, and said: where are you going, O Muhajireen? I said: We are looking for these brothers of ours, the Ansar, They said. You should not go near them; do whatever you have already decided, O Muhajireen. I said: By Allah, we will go to them. So we carried on until we came to them in Saqeefat Banu Sa`idah, where we found them gathered and among them was a man wrapped up [in a garment. I said: Who is this? They said: Sa`d bin `Ubadah. ! said: What is the matter with him? They said: He is sick. After we sat down, their spokesman stood up and praised and glorified Allah, may He glorified and exalted, as He deserves, then he said: To proceed. We are the supporters (Ansar) of Allah and the majority of the Muslim army. You, O Muhajireen, are a small group among us. Some of you came to us, wanting to deny who we are and prevent us from attaining a position of authority. When he fell silent, I wanted to present a speech that I had prepared and that I liked in front of Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) I used to avoid provoking him and he was more forbearing and more dignified than me. But Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) said: Wait a while. I did not like to make him angry, and he was more knowledgeable and more dignified than me. By Allah, he did not omit any word that I liked in the speech I had prepared but he said something like it or better, speaking spontaneously, until he finished speaking. Then he said: To proceed. Whatever you have mentioned about your achievements and virtues, is correct. The Arabs would not acknowledge the leadership of anyone except someone from this tribe of Quraish, for they are the best of the Arabs in lineage and location. I am pleased to suggest to you one of these two men, whichever of them you want. Then he took hold of my hand and the hand of Abu `Ubaidah bin al-Jarrah, and I disliked nothing of what he had said apart from this, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck struck for no sin on my part than to become the leader of people among whom was Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) unless my own self suggested something at the time of death. One of the Ansar said: I am the post on which the camel with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree [i.e., a noble]. [I suggest] a ruler from among us and a ruler from among you, O Quraish. - I the narrator said to Malik; What does ‘I am the post on which the cainc! with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree` mean? He said:It is as if he is saying, I am the smart one who has the answer. - Then there was a great deal of clamour and raised voices, to such an extent that I feared there would be a conflict, so I said: Hold out your hand, O Abu Bakr. So he held out his hand and I swore allegiance to him, and the Muhajireen swore allegiance to him, then the Ansar swore allegiance to him. Thus we surrounded Sa`d bin ‘Ubadah. One of them said: You have killed Sa`d i said: May Allah kill Sa’d! And `Umar (رضي الله عنه) said: By Allah, we never encountered any problem greater than the swearing of allegiance to Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) . We were afraid that if we left the people without having sworn allegiance to anyone, they might swear allegiance after we were gone, so we would either follow in their footsteps and swear allegiance to someone we were not pleased with, or we would disagree with them and that would cause trouble. If anyone swears allegiance to a leader without consulting the Muslims, there is no allegiance for him and no allegiance to the one who swore allegiance to him, lest both of them be killed. Malik said: Ibn Shihab told me, from `Urwah bin az-Zubair, that the men whom they met were `Uwaim bin Sa`idah and Ma`n bin `Adiyy. Ibn Shihab said. Sa`eed bin al-Musayyab told me that the one who said, I am the post on which the camel with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree, was al-lubab bin al-Mundhir.";Musnad Ahmad 391, Book 3, Hadith 1;question #6;What was the reaction of the Ansar and Muhajireen during the discussion of leadership after the Prophet's death?
"Ibn ‘Abbas (رضي الله عنه) said to us.  I said to ‘Uthman bin `Affan: What made you take al-Anfal, which is one of al-Mathani (the seven long soorahs), and Bara`ah, which is one of al-Mi`een (soorahs with one hundred verses or thereabouts), and put them next to one another and not write - Ibn Ja`far said: A line between them saying Bismillahir-Rahmanir-Raheem - and you put them with the seven long ones? What made you do that? `Uthman (رضي الله عنه)said: Sometimes many soorahs would be revealed (incomplete) to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) , and when something was revealed he would call one of the scribes to write it down for him and say: “Put this in the Soorah in which such and such is mentioned`; and verses would be revealed to him and he would say, `Put these verses in the soorah in which such and such is mentioned”; and a verse would be revealed to him and he would say: `Put this verse in the soorah in which such and such is mentioned.” Al-Anfal was one of the first soorahs to be revealed in Madinah and Bara`ah was one of the last soorahs of the Qur`an, and the stories and content of the two soorahs were similar. 
Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  passed away without having stated clearly to us that it was part of it, but we thought that it was, hence I put them together and I did not put between them the line Bismillahir-Rahmanir-Raheem. Ibn Ja`far said: I put it with the seven long ones.";Musnad Ahmad 399, Book 4, Hadith 1;question #6;What similarities exist between the content of Surahs Al-Anfal and Bara'ah?
"he rinsed his mouth and nose, then he washed his face three times, his arms three times each, and wiped his head and the tops of his feet, then he smiled and said to his companions: Aren`t you going to ask me what made me smile? They said: What made you smile, O Ameer al-Mu`mineen? He said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  call for water near this spot, then he did wudoo’ as I have done it, then he smiled and said: `Aren`t you going to ask me what made me smile?` They said: What made you smile, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? He said: “If a person calls for (water for) wudoo’, then he washes his face, Allah will remove from him every sin that he committed with his face; when he washes his arms, the same applies; when he wipes his head, the same applies; when he purifies his feet, the same applies.”";Musnad Ahmad 415, Book 4, Hadith 16;question #6;How does the act of wudoo' relate to the forgiveness of sins committed by different parts of the body?
My masters married me to a Roman slave girl of theirs. I was intimate with her and she bore me a boy who was black like me and i named him `Abdullah. Then l was intimate with her again and she bore me a boy who was black like me, and I named him Ubaidullah. Then she was corrupted by a Roman slave of my masters, whose name was Yuhannas and he spoke to her in their language. Then she gave birth to a boy who looked like a lizard (i.e., was very fair). I said to her: What is this? She said: He is the child of Yohannas. So we referred the case to Ameer al-Mu`mineen `Uthman (رضي الله عنه) - Mahdi said: I think he said: And he asked then both- and they confessed. He said. Will you agree to me passing judgement between you according to the judgement of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ? He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  ruled that the child be attributed to the (husband of the) woman, and the fornicator gets nothing. Mahdi said: and I think he said: He flogged her and him, and they were both slaves,It was narrated from Rabah... he mentioned a similar hadeeth. He said: I took them to Ameer al-Mu`mineen `Uthman bin `Affan {رضي الله عنه}, who said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  ruled that the child be attributed to (the husband of the woman... and he mentioned a similar report;Musnad Ahmad 416, 417, Book 4, Hadith 17;question #6;What is the significance of the judgment of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in resolving legal disputes in Islam?

And some men testified to what he said. Then he said: I adjure by Allah anyone who was present with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the day of Bai’atul-Ridwan, when he had sent me to the mushrikeen, the people of Makkah; he said, `This is my hand and this is the hand of `Uthman,` and he swore allegiance on my behalf. And some men testified to what he said. Then he said:l adjure by Allah anyone who was present when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Who will expand the mosque by incorporating this house into it, in return for a house in Paradise?” and I bought it with my wealth and expanded the mosque by incorporating it into it. And some men testified to what he said. Then he said: I adjure by Allah anyone who saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the day of the army of hardship (i.e., Tabook), when he said: `Who will spend today a spending that will be accepted by Allah?` and I equipped half of the army with my wealth. And some men testified to what he said, Then he said:I adjure by Allah anyone who saw the water of Roomah (a well) being sold to wayfarers, then I bought it with my own wealth and gave it to wayfarers for free.` And some men testified to what he said.";Musnad Ahmad 420, Book 4, Hadith 19;question #6;What role does testimony play in verifying historical events in Islamic tradition?
"`Umar bin al-Khattab (رضي الله عنه) sent for me, and whilst I was like that, his freed slave Yarfa` came and said: ‘Uthman, `Abdur-Rahman, Sa’d and az-Zubair bin al-`Awwam are here - (the narrator) said: I do not know whether he mentioned Talhah or not - and they are asking for permission to enter upon you. He said: Let them in. Then after a while, (Yarfa`) came and said: al-`Abbas and ‘Ali are asking permission to enter upon you. He said: Let them in. When al`Abbas came in, he said: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, judge between me and this one. They had a dispute at that time concerning the fai’ (booty) that Allah had granted to His Messenger of the wealth of Banun-Nadeer, The people said: Judge between them, O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, and relieve each one of his opponent, for their dispute has gone on too long. ‘Umar (رضي الله عنه) said: I adjure you by Allah, by Whose Leave heaven and earth exist, do you know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said, “We are not to be inherited from; what we leave behind is charity`? They said: He did say that. He said: I shall tell you about that fai`; Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, gave something exclusively to His Prophet (ﷺ) that He did not give to anyone else. And he quoted the verse: `And what Allah gave as booty (Fai’) to His Messenger
(Muhammad (ﷺ)) from them - for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry` [al Hashr 59:6]. He said: `This was exclusively for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and by Allah, he did not keep it to himself in exclusion of you and he did not prefer himself over you with regard to it. Rather he gave it to you and divided it among you until there was nothing left of it except this property. He spent on his family`s needs from this property for one year, then he took what was left and regarded it as the property of Allah.

"I was with ‘Uthman (رضي الله عنه) in the house when he was under siege. We would go into an entryway where, when we entered it, we could hear what the people were saying in al-Balat. `Uthman (رضي الله عنه) entered it one day for some reason, then he came out with his face flushed and said: They were threatening to kill me just now. We said: Allah will suffice you against them, O Ameer al-Mu`mineen. He said: Why would they kill me? I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: “It is not permissible to shed the blood of a Muslim man except in one of three cases; a man who disbelieved after having become Muslim, or a man who committed zina after being married, or a man who killed a person not in retaliation of murder But by Allah, I never committed zina either during the Jahiliyyah or in Islam...

I will never be the first successor of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  to shed blood among his ummah; as for going out to Makkah because they will never try to kill me there, I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say, “A man of Quraish will commit profanity in Makkah and half the punishment of the world will be upon him`, and I will never be that one; as for going to Syria, because they are the people of Syria and Mu`awiyah is among them, I shall never leave the land to which I migrated, where I am close to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)

They said: By Allah, yes.;Musnad Ahmad 555, Book 4, Hadith 147;question #6;How did Uthman demonstrate his commitment to the welfare of the Muslims through his personal wealth?
`Abdur-Rahman bin ‘Awf met al-Waleed bin `Uqbah Al-Waleed said to him: Why do I see you keeping away from Ameer al-Mu`mineen `Uthman (رضي الله عنه)? `AbdurRahman said to him. Tell him that I did not flee on the day of `Ainain - ` Asim said: The day of Uhud - and I did not stay behind on the day of Badr, and I did not turn away from the way of ‘Umar (رضي الله عنه). So he went and told that to `Uthman (رضي الله عنه), who said: As for his saying that he did not flee on the day of `Ainain, how could he shame me for a fault for which Allah has pardoned me and said: `Those of you who turned back on the day the two hosts met (i.e. the battle of Uhud), it was Shaitan (Satan) who caused them to backslide (run away from the battlefield) because of some (sins) they had earned. But Allah, indeed, has forgiven them.` [Al ‘Imran 3:155]? As for his saying that I stayed behind on the day of Badr, I was tending Ruqayyah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), when she was dying, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  allocated to me a share (of the booty), and whoever was allocated a share by the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  was present.... and he quoted the hadeeth at length to the end.;Musnad Ahmad 556, Book 4, Hadith 148;question #6;How does the allocation of war booty reflect one's participation and contribution in Islamic battles?
"Verily Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, sent Muhammad (ﷺ) with the truth and I was one of those who responded to (the call of) Allah and His Messenger, and I believed in that with which Muhammad (ﷺ) was sent. Then I migrated twice, and I also attained the honour of becoming the son-in-law of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ); I swore allegiance to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and by Allah, I never disobeyed him or betrayed him until Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, took his soul in death.";Musnad Ahmad 561, Book 4, Hadith 152;question #6;How is the truthfulness of a companion of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) emphasized in Islamic narrations?
"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood in `Arafah and said: `This is the place of standing and all of `Arafah is a place of standing.` He moved on when the sun set, then he put Usamah behind him (on his mount) and moved on at a measured pace on his camel, and the people started rushing right and left. He turned to them and said: `Calmly, O people.” Then he came to Jam` and led them in praying two prayers, Maghrib and `Isha`. Then he stayed all night until morning came, then he came to Quzah and stood at Quzah, and said: `This is the place of standing and all of Jam` is a place of standing.” Then he moved on until he came to Muhassir, where he stood, then he struck his she-camel and she trotted until he crossed the valley, then he reined her in. Then he put al-Fadl behind him (on his mount) and carried on until he came to the Jamrah. He stoned it, then he came to the place of sacrifice and said: `This is the place of sacrifice and all of Mina is a place of sacrifice.` He [the narrator] said: A young woman of Khath’am asked him: My father is an old man and has become senile; he has lived until Allah made Hajj obligatory, Will it be acceptable if I perform Hajj on his behalf? He said: `Yes; perform Hajj on behalf of your father.` And he twisted al Fadl`s neck (to turn his face away). Al-`Abbas said to him: O Messenger of Allah, why did you twist the neck of your cousin? He said: `I saw a young man and a young woman and I was not certain that they would be safe from the Shaitan.` Then a man came to him and said: O Messenger of Allah, I shaved my head before offering a sacrifice. He said: “Offer your sacrifice, there is no problem.” Then another man came to him and said: O Messenger of Allah, I did tawafal-ifadah before shaving my head. He said: “Shave your head or cut your hair, there is no problem.` Then he came to the Ka`bah and circumambulated it, then he came to Zamzam and said: `O Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib, it is your right to draw water for pilgrims. Were it not that the people would overwhelm you, I would have drawn water myself.`";Musnad Ahmad 562, Book 5, Hadith 1;question #6;What role did the family of `Abdul-Muttalib have in serving the pilgrims at Zamzam?
"`This is the place of standing, and all of `Arafah is a place of standing.` Then he moved on at an unhurried pace, and the people started rushing right and left. He turned to them and said: `Calmly, O, people; calmly, O people.` Then he came to al-Muzdalifah between the two prayers, then he stood in al-Muzdalifah and he stood at Quzah, with al-Fadl bin Abbas riding behind him, and he said: “This is the place of standing and all of Muzdalifah is a place of standing.” Then he moved on at an unhurried pace and the people started rushing right and left. He turned to them and said: `Calmly, calmly, O people.” He came to Muhassir and struck his mount, and it trotted until he left (the valley) then he resumed his original pace until he (came and) stoned the Jamrah. Then he went to the place of sacrifice and said: `This is the place of sacrifice and all of Mina is a place of sacrifice.” Then a young woman from Khath`am came and said: My father is an old man and has become senile; he has lived until Allah made Hajj obligatory, but he cannot do it. Will it be acceptable if i perform Hajj on his behalf? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Yes”. And he started turning the face of al-Fadl bin al-`Abbas away from her. Then a man came to him and said: I stoned the jamrah and did tawafal-ifadah and put on my ordinary clothes, but I did not shave my head. He said: `No problem, go ahead and shave your head.” Then another man came to him and said: I stoned the Jamrah and shaved my head and put on my ordinary clothes, but I did not offer the sacrifice. He said: “No problem, go ahead and offer the sacrifice.” Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did tawafal-ifadah, then he called for a bucket of Zamzam water and drank from it and did wudoo’. Then he said: “Draw water, O Banu `Abdul-Muttalib, Were it not that you would be overwhelmed, I would have drawn water myself.” Al-`Abbas said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), why did I see you turning your cousin`s face away? He said: `I saw a young man and a young woman and I feared that the Shaitan might tempt them.”";Musnad Ahmad 564, Book 5, Hadith 3;question #6;What role does Zamzam water play in the Hajj rituals according to the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)?
"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent me to Yemen, and we came to some people who had built a trap for a lion. They began to push one another, and one man fell, so he grabbed onto another one, who then grabbed onto another one, until all four of them ended up in the trap and the lion wounded them. Then a man came and killed the lion with a spear, and they all died of their wounds, The next of kin of the first man went to the next of kin of the last man, and they took out weapons to fight, then `Ali came to them straight away and said: Do you want to fight one another when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is still alive? I will judge between you, and if you agree then that is the verdict, otherwise keep away from one another until you go to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he will be the one who judges between you, then whoever transgresses after that will have no right. Collect from the tribes of those who fell into the hole one quarter of the diyah [blood money], one third of the diyah, one half of the diyah and a complete diyah. For the first man (who fell in) there will be one quarter, because he caused the death of the one who came after him; for the second one there is one third of the diyah; and for the third one there is half of the diyah. They refused to accept that, so they went to the Prophet (ﷺ) when he was at Maqam Ibraheem and told him the story, and he said: “I will judge between you.” One of the people said: `Ali has already passed judgement. They told him about it and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) approved it.

It was narrated from Hanash that `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: The fourth one gets the diyah (blood money] in full.";Musnad Ahmad 573, Book 5, Hadith 12;question #6;How does the approval of the Prophet (ﷺ) validate the judgments made by his companions?
I heard ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) say: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent me, az-Zubair and al-Miqdad, and he said: “Go to the garden of Khakh, where you will find a woman riding a camel with whom there is a letter, and take it from her.” We set out with our horses galloping, until we reached that garden, and there we found the woman. We said: Give us the letter. She said: I do not have any letter. We said: Either you give us the letter or we will remove your clothes. So she brought it out from her braided hair, and we took it and brought it to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and in it (was written): From Hatib bin Abi Balta`ah to some of the mushrikeen of Makkah, telling them about some of the plans of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `O Hatib, what is this?` He said: Do not be hasty in judging me, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I am a man who was attached to Quraish but I was one of them. The Muhajireen who are with you have relatives who will protect their families in Makkah, and I wanted, as i have no blood ties among them, to do them a favour so that they would protect my family. I did not do it out of kufr or because I apostatized from my religion, or because I approved of Kufr after becoming Muslim. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `He has told you the truth.` `Umar (رضي الله عنه) said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), let me strike the neck of this hypocrite. He said: “He was present at Badr, and you do not know, perhaps Allah looked upon the people of Badr and said: `Do what you wish, for I have forgiven you.`;Musnad Ahmad 600, Book 5, Hadith 37;question #6;What was Umar's reaction to Hatib's actions, and how did the Prophet (ﷺ) address it?

`Ali bin Abi Talib (رضي الله عنه) addressed us and said: Whoever claims that we have something that we recite apart from the Book of Allah and this document in which are the ages of camels [to be given as diyah or blood money] and rulings concerning injuries, is lying. And in it the Prophet (ﷺ) said: `Madinah is sacred, the area between ‘Air and Thawr. Whoever commits any offence, or gives refuge to an offender, upon him will be the curse of Allah, the angels and all the people, and on the Day of Resurrection Allah will not accept any obligatory or nafil act of worship from him. Whoever claims to belong to someone other than his father or to belong to someone other than his masters (who manumitted him), upon him be the curse of Allah, the Angels and all the people, and on the Day of Resurrection Allah will not accept any nafil or obligatory act of worship from him.

He raised his head and said: `There is no soul among you but his place in Paradise or Hell is known.” They said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), why should we strive? He said: `Keep striving for everyone will be helped to do that for which he was created. As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah and fears Him. And believes in Al-Husna. 
Al-Husna: The Best (i.e. either la ilaha illallah: none has the right to be worshipped but Allah) or a reward from Allah (i.e. Allah will compensate him for what he will spend in Allah`s way or bless him with Paradise)
We will make smooth for him the path of ease (goodness). But he who is greedy miser and thinks himself self-sufficient, And belies Al-Husna, We will make smooth for him the path for evil, [al-Lail 92:5-10].`";Musnad Ahmad 621, Book 5, Hadith 58;question #6;What does the hadith imply about the role of charity and piety in shaping one's destiny?
`Ali entered upon me in In house and called for water for wudoo’. I brought him a wooden vessel that held a mudd or thereabouts and put it in front of him. He had urinated and he said: O Ibn ‘Abbas, shall I not do wudoo’ for you as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did wudoo’? I said: Yes, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you. He said: A vessel was placed before him and he washed his hands, then he rinsed his mouth, and took water into his nose and blew it out.

`Climb onto my shoulders.” So I climbed on to his shoulders and he stood up with me. I felt that if I had wanted to, I could have reached the edge of the sky. I climbed up onto the top of the House, where there was a statue of brass or copper. I started shaking it right and left, forwards and backwards until, when I had managed to loosen it, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said to me: “Throw it down.” I threw it down and it broke like a glass bottle, Then I came down and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  and I ran and hid among the houses lest any of the people see us.;Musnad Ahmad 644, Book 5, Hadith 80;question #6;What measures did the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) and Ali take to avoid being seen after removing the statue?
"I heard Ameer al-Mu’mineen ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) say: I met Fatimah, al-’Abbas and Zaid bin Harithah in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Al-`Abbas said, O Messenger of Allah  (ﷺ), I have grown old and my bones have grown weak, and I need more sustenance. If you see fit, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), to order such and such measure of food for me, then do so. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `We will do it.` Fatimah said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), if you see fit to order that I be given what you have given to your paternal uncle, then do so. The Messenger of Allah  (ﷺ) said: `We will do it.` Then Zaid bin Harithah said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), you gave me land from which I made my livelihood, then you took it back; if you see fit to return it to me, then do so. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `We will do that.` I said: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) , if you see fit to put me in charge of the use of share of the khumus that Allah has decreed for us in His Book, I shall divide it whilst you are still alive so that no one will dispute it with me after you are gone. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “We will do that.” And the Messenger of Allah  (ﷺ) appointed me in charge of it and I divided it during his lifetime. Then Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) put me in charge of it and I divided it during his lifetime. Then ‘Umar   (رضي الله عنه)put me in charge of it and I divided it during his lifetime until the last year of ‘Umar`s reign, when a great deal of wealth came to him.";Musnad Ahmad 646, Book 5, Hadith 82;question #6;How was wealth and resources managed and distributed among the early Muslim community according to this narration?
"Be patient, Abu `Abdullah; be patient, Abu ‘Abdullah, on the banks of the Euphrates. I said: what did he say? He said: I entered upon the Prophet (ﷺ) one day and his eyes were flowing with tears. I said: O Prophet (ﷺ) of Allah, has someone upset you? Why are your eyes flowing with tears? He said: `No, but Jibreel left me a while ago. He told me that al-Husain would be killed on the banks of the Euphrates, And he said: `Would you like to smell his dust (the dust of the land where he will fall)?` I said: Yes.

"I asked `Ali (رضي الله عنه) about the nafl prayers of the Prophet (ﷺ)  during the day. He said: You are not able for that. We said: Tell us and we will do as much of it as we can, He said: When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed Fajr, he would wait until the sun would rise from there, meaning in the east, as high as it is at the time of `Asr there, meaning in the west. Then he would get up and pray two rak`ahs. Then he would wait until the sun rose as high there, meaning in the east, as it is at the time of Zuhr there, meaning in the west; then he would pray four rak`ahs, and four before Zuhr when the sun passed the meridian, and four afterwards, and four before ‘Asr, He would separate each two rak’ahs with salams upon the angels who are close to Allah, the Prophets, the believers and the Muslims who follow them. `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: That is sixteen rak`ahs which the Prophet (ﷺ) offered as nafl prayers during the day, but there are very few who offer them regularly. Wakee’ narrated; my father said: Habeeb bin Abi Thabit said to Abu Ishaq when he narrated this to him: O Abu Ishaq, this hadeeth of yours is worth this mosque filled with gold.";Musnad Ahmad 650, Book 5, Hadith 86;question #6;Why might a hadith be considered valuable or significant in Islamic tradition?
"`Abdullah bin Shaddad came and entered upon `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) when we were sitting with her, as he was returning from Iraq during the time when ‘Ali           (رضي الله عنه) was murdered. She said to him: O `Abdullah bin Shaddad, will you tell me the truth about what I am going to ask you? Tell me about these people whom ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) killed. He said: Why shouldn`t I tell you the truth? She said: Tell me about them. He said: When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) corresponded with Mu`awiyah and the two arbitrators gave their verdict, eight thousand of the pious rebelled against him and camped in a land called Haroora`, near Koofah. They criticised him and said: You have taken off a chemise that Allah caused you to wear and a title that Allah gave to you, then you went ahead and asked people to issue a decree concerning the religion of Allah. There is no ruling except the ruling of Allah, may He be exalted. When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) heard about their criticism of him and the reason why they had split from him, he told his caller not to admit anyone but those who had memorised the Qur`an. When the house was filled with people who had memorised the Qur`an, he called for a large Mushaf and put it front of him, and he started tapping it with his hand, saying: O Mushaf, tell the people. The people called out: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, how could you ask it? It is only ink and paper, but we could speak on the basis of what we understand from it. What do you want? He said: These companions of yours who rebelled, between me and them is the Book of Allah, and Allah says in His Book concerning a woman and a man: `If you fear a breach between them twain (the man and his wife), appoint (two) arbitrators, one from his family and the other from hers; if they both wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation.` [an-Nisa 4:35]. The ummah of Muhammad is more important with regard to life and sanctity than a woman and a man. They got angry with me when I wrote a document between me and Mu`awiyah and wrote `Ali bin Abi Talib [without adding the title Ameer al-Mu`mineen]. But Suhail bin `Amr came to us when we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at al-Hudaibiyah, when he made a peace deal with Quraish, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote, `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.` Suhail said: Do not write, In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He said: What should we write? He said: Write: `In Your Name, O Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Write `Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).` He [Suhail] said: If I knew that you were the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I would not have opposed you. So he wrote: This is what was agreed by Muhammad bin `Abdullah with Quraish. And Allah says in His Book: “Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day` [Al-Ahzab 33:21]. So `Ali sent `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه) to them and I went out with him until we reached the middle of their camp. Ibnul-Kawwa` stood up and addressed the people, saying: O bearers of the Qur`an, this is `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه). Whoever does not know him, I know of the Book of Allah what can tell you about him, He is one of those concerning whom the words `they are a quarrelsome people` [Az-Zukhruf 43:58] were revealed. Tell him to go back to the one who sent him and do not discuss the Book of Allah with him. Their spokesmen stood up and said: By Allah, we will discuss the Book of Allah. If he says something sound and true that we recognise we will follow him, and if he says something false we will reject his false argument. So they discussed the Book with ‘Abdullah for three days, and four thousand of them recanted and all of them repented, including Ibnul-Kawwa`. He took them to `Ali in Koofah, and `Ali sent word to the rest of them, saying: You know the turmoil between us and our opponents. Stay wherever you wish until the ummah of Muhammad (ﷺ) is united. The deal between us and you is that you should not shed any blood that it is forbidden to shed or commit acts of banditry on the roads or do wrong to any Non Muslim under Muslim protection. If you do that, we will declare war, for Allah does not love those who betray. `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) said: O Ibn Shaddad, did he kill them? He said: By Allah, no sooner had he sent this message to them but they committed acts of banditry, shed blood and regarded it as permissible to harm Ahludh-Dhimmah (non-Muslims living under Muslim protection). She said: Do you swear by Allah? He said: I swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other god that this is what happened. She said: I have heard that the people of Iraq are talking and saying dhuth-thuda, dhuth-thuda [i.e., the one with a deformed arm that looks like a breast]. He said: I saw him and I was with ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) when he was examining the slain. He called the people and said: Do you know this one? How many of them came and said: I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so, and I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so. And there was no proof of who he was except that. She said: What did `Ali say when he stood over him, as the people of Iraq claim? He said: I heard him say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. She said: Did you hear him say anything other than that? He said: No, by Allah. She said: Yes, Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. May Allah have mercy on `Ali (رضي الله عنه): it was his habit, if he saw something he liked, to say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. But the people of Iraq fabricated lies against him and added words to what he said.";Musnad Ahmad 656, Book 5, Hadith 92;question #6;How did Aisha (رضي الله عنها) verify the truth of the events that occurred during the conflict?
"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was at a funeral and he said: `which of you will go to the city and not leave in it any idol but he will break it, or any grave but he will level it, or any image but he will spoil it?` A man said: “I will, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).` So he went, but he was afraid of the people of the city, so he came back, `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: I will go, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: “Go.` So he went then he came back and said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I did not leave in it any idol but I broke it, or any grave but i levelled it, or any image but I spoiled it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Whoever goes back to doing any of that has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad.` Then he said: `Do not be a cause of division or show off or be a merchant except a good one, for those are the ones who are lagging behind in good deeds.`


It was narrated from Al-Hakam that A man from Basra whom the people of Basra called Abu Muwarri’ and the people of Koofah called Abu Muhammad, said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was at a funeral... and he mentioned a similar Hadeeth, but he did not say that ‘Ali said: `or any image but he will smear something over it.` And he said: I did not come to you, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), until I did not leave any image but i spoiled it.` And he said: `Do not be a cause of division or show off.`";Musnad Ahmad 657, 658, Book 5, Hadith 93;question #6;What is the significance of being a 'good merchant' as mentioned in the hadith?

"When the Khawarij rebelled and fought in An-Nahrawan, ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) stood before his companions and said: These people have shed blood that it is forbidden to shed and have raided the flocks of the people. They are the closest of the enemy to you, but if you go to your enemy, I am afraid that these people may attack what you leave behind. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: `Some rebels will emerge from my ummah, your prayer will be as nothing compared to their prayer, and your fasting will be as nothing compared to their fasting, and your recitation will be as nothing compared to their recitation. They will recite the Qur`an, thinking that it is in their favour, but it will be against them; it will go no further than their throats. They will pass out of Islam as the arrow passes out of the prey. The sign of that is that among them will be a man who has an upper arm but no forearm, and on it will be something like the nipple of a breast, on which will be some white hairs.` If the army that fights them knew what reward they will have, as spoken on the lips of their Prophet (ﷺ), they would cease striving and rely on that.

On Friday, the devils emerge to try to push the people to the markets, and they have banners with them. The angels sit at the doors of the mosques, writing down people`s names according to their status: the one who comes early, the one who prays, and the one who comes after him, until the imam comes out. Whoever is close to the imam and is silent or listens, and does not engage in idle talk, will have a twofold reward. The one who is further away from the imam but is silent or listens, and does not engage in idle talk will have one reward. The one who is close to the imam but engages in idle talk and does not keep silent or listen will have a twofold burden of sin. The one who is further away from the imam and engages in idle talk and does not keep silent and listen will have one burden of sin. And the one who says, Be quiet, has spoken, and the one who speaks has no Jumu’ah.

The people said: O Ameer al Mu`mineen, we kept you away from your family, your land and your trade, it is yours. He said to me: what do you think? I said: That they have suggested something to you. He said: Speak. I said: Why do you want to opt for uncertainty rather than certainty? He said Stop talking like that. I said: Yes, by Allah, I will stop. Do you remember when the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) sent you to collect zakah, and you went to al-`Abbas bin ‘Abdul-Muttalib (رضي الله عنه) and he withheld something from you? There was some misunderstanding between you and you said to me: Come with me to the Prophet (ﷺ), but we found him feeling low, so we went back. Then the next morning we came to him and we found him in a good mood, so you told him what had happened and he said to you: “Don`t you know that a man`s uncle is like his father?` We told him what we had seen of his low mood the day before and what we saw of his good mood on the second day, and he said: “You came to me on the first day when I still had two dinars of the zakah left over, and what you saw of my low mood was because of that. And when you came to me today, I had given them [to someone] and that is why you saw me in a good mood` `Umar (رضي الله عنه) said. By Allah, you are speaking the truth; I should be grateful to you in this world and in the Hereafter.";Musnad Ahmad 725, Book 5, Hadith 158;question #6;How does gratitude manifest in relationships according to Islamic principles?
`I have turned my face in submission to the One who originated the heavens and the earth, as a monotheist and a Muslim, and I am not one of the mushrikeen.

He has no partner, And of this I have been commanded, and I am one of the Muslims [Abun-Nadr said: and I am the first of the Muslims]. O Allah, there is no god but You. You are my Lord and I am Your slave. I have wronged myself and I admit my sin, so forgive me all my sins, for no one can forgive sins except You. Guide me to the best of conduct, for none can guide to that except You and divert from me bad conduct, for no one can divert it from me except You. Blessed and exalted are You, I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You.” When he bowed, he said: `O Allah, to You I have bowed, in You I have believed and to You I have submitted.

My face has prostrated to the One Who created it, shaped it and gave it a good shape, and opened its hearing and sight. Blessed be Allah, the Best of creators.` Then he after said the salam at the end of the prayer: `O Allah, forgive me my past and future sins, what I have done in secret and what I have done openly, what I have transgressed and what You know more than I.

When he got on it, he said: Glory be to the One Who has placed this (transport) at our service and we ourselves would not have been capable of that, and to our Lord is our final destiny. Then he said Alhamdulillah three times and Allahu Akbar three times, then he said: Glory be to You, there is no god but You. I have indeed wronged myself, so forgive me. Then he smiled, and I said: Why are you smiting, O Ameer al-Mu`mimeen?

"Are you visiting al-Hasan [during his sickness] when you feel what you feel? He said to him: You are not my Lord, to direct my heart as you will. ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: That does not prevent us from giving you advice. I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  say: `There is no Muslim who visits his sick brother, but Allah will send to him seventy thousand angels who will send blessings upon him from whatever hour of the day it is until evening comes, and from whatever hour of the night it is until morning comes. `Amr said to him: What do you say about walking in front of or behind the bier at a funeral? `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said. The superiority of walking behind it over walking in front of it is like the superiority of offering a prescribed prayer in congregation over offering the prayer alone. `Amr said: But I saw Abu Bakr und ‘Umar  walking in front of the bier, Ali (رضي الله عنه) said; They did not like to embarrass the people.";Musnad Ahmad 754, Book 5, Hadith 186;question #6;What role does giving advice play in Islamic interactions, especially during times of illness?

When we left Makkah, the daughter of Hamzah followed us, crying: O uncle, O uncle. I took her by the hand and gave her to Fatimah and said: Here is your cousin. When we came to Madinah, Ja`far, Zaid bin Harithah and I disputed concerning her, Ja`far said: She is the daughter of my paternal uncle and her maternal aunt is married to me - meaning Asma’ bint `Umais, Zaid said. She is the daughter of my brother. I said: I took her and she is the daughter of my paternal uncle. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “As for you, O Ja`far, you resemble me in appearance and attitude. As for you, O Ali, you are of me and I am of you. As for you, O Zaid, you are our brother and our freed slave.

"Abul-Harith was in charge of some of the affairs of Makkah at the time of `Uthman. `Uthman (رضي الله عنه) came to Makkah and `Abdullah bin Al-Harith said: I welcomed ‘Uthman in the camp at Qudaid. The people of the oasis caught a partridge and cooked it in water and salt, then they cut it into pieces to make thareed, and we offered it to `Uthman and his companions, but they refused to eat it. `Uthman (رضي الله عنه) said: It is game that I did not catch and I did not order it to be caught; it was caught by people who are not in ihram, and they have offered it to us, so there is nothing wrong with it. `Uthman said, Who can say something about this issue? They said: `Ali. So he sent for `Ali (رضي الله عنه), who came to him. `Abdullah bin Al-Harith said: It is as if I can see ‘Ali when he came, brushing some leaves off his hands. `Uthman (رضي الله عنه) said to him: Game that we did not catch and we did not order it to be caught; it was caught by people who are not in ihram and they offered it to us, so there is nothing wrong with it. ‘Ali got angry and said: I adjure any man who was present with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when the meat of an onager was brought and the Messenger of Allah      (ﷺ) said: “We are people who are in ihram; give it to people who are not in ihram.” Twelve of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) bore witness to that. Then `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: I adjure by Allah, any man who was present with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when some ostrich eggs were brought and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `We are people who are in ihram; give them to people who are not in ihram.` Fewer than twelve men bore witness.

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) entered upon me when I was sleeping on the mattress. Al-Hasan or Al-Husain asked for a drink, so the Prophet (ﷺ) went to a young sheep and milked it, then Al-Hasan came to him and the Prophet (ﷺ) told him to wait. Fatimah said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), it is as if he is the dearer of the two to you? He said: “No, but he asked for a drink first.” Then he said: `You and I and these two and this one who is sleeping will be in the same place on the Day of Resurrection.”;Musnad Ahmad 792, Book 5, Hadith 224;question #6;What does the hadith imply about the status of the Prophet's family on the Day of Resurrection?

And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims, O Allah, You are the Sovereign, there is no god but You. You are my Lord and I am Your slave. I have wronged myself and I admit my sin, so forgive me all my sins, for no one can forgive sins except You. O Allah, guide me to the best of conduct, for none can guide to that except You; divert from me the worst of conduct, for none can divert it except You. Here I am at Your service, all goodness is in Your hand and evil cannot be attributed to You. My existence is due to You and my return is to You.

"Abu `Abdur-Rahman as-Sulami and Hibban bin `Atiyyah had a dispute. `Abdur-Rahman said to Hibban: I know what made your companion - meaning `Ali (رضي الله عنه) - audacious. He said: What is it, may you be bereft of your father? He said. Something I heard `Ali (رضي الله عنه) say. He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  sent me, az-Zubair and Abu Marthad on a mission, and we were all horsemen. He said: `Go to Rawdat Khakh, for there you will find a woman who has a letter with her from Hatib bin Abi Balta`ah to the mushrikeen; bring it to me.` So we went on our horses until we caught up with her where the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had told us, travelling on a camel of hers. He [Hatib] had written to the people of Makkah, telling them about the march of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). We said to her. Where is the letter you have with you? She said: I do not have any letter. We made her camel kneel down and searched her luggage for it, but we did not find anything. My two companions said: We do not see any letter with her, I said: You know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not tell a lie. Then I swore: By the One by whom oaths are sworn, you will give us the letter or we will remove your clothes. She stretched out her hand to her girdle, which was wrapped around her, and brought out the letter. I brought it to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and they said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he has betrayed Allah and His Messenger and the believers; let me strike his neck. He said: `O Hatib, what made you do what you did?` He said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), by Allah, it is not that I do not believe in Allah and His Messenger, but I wanted to do a favour for the people by means of which Allah might protect my family and my property, for every one of your Companions has some of his people there through whom Allah will protect his family and his property. He said: You have spoken the truth, do not say anything to him but good.` ʻUmar said: O, Messenger of Allah, he betrayed Allah and His Messenger and the believers, let me strike his neck.

"By Allah, I have brought water until I felt a pain in my chest. He said: Some captives have been brought to your father, go and ask him for a servant. She said: And I, by Allah, have ground flour until my hands became sore. So she went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said: “What brings you here, O my daughter?” She said: I have come to greet you; and she felt too shy to ask him, so she went back, ‘Ali said: What happened? She said: I felt too shy to ask him. So we went together and I said: O Messenger of Allah, by Allah I have brought water until I started to feel pain in my chest. And Fatimah said: I have ground flour until my hands hurt. Allah has brought you plenty of captives, so give us a servant. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “By Allah, I will not give it to you and leave ahlus-suffah starving when I have nothing to spend on them. Rather I will sell them (the captives) and spend the price on (ahlus-suffah).” So they went back. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) came, when they were under the cover which, if it covered their heads, it left their feet bare, and if it covered their feet, it left their heads bare. They wanted to get up, but he said: `Stay where you are.` And then he said: `Shall I not tell you of something that is better than what you asked for?” They said: Yes. He said: `(It is) words that Jibreel (عليه السلام) taught me.` He said: “Following every prayer, glorify Allah ten times, and praise Him ten times and magnify Him ten times. And when you go to your bed, glorify Allah thirty-three times, praise Him thirty-three times and magniÍy Him thirty-four times.” He said: By Allah, I never omitted that from the time the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) taught it to me.

Their sign is that among them will be a black man with a deformed hand, with black hairs on his hand.” If it is him, you will have killed the worst of people, and if it is not him, you will have killed the best of people.” We wept, then he said: Go and look.

The Prophet (ﷺ) was trying to find out about the well of Badr, and when we heard that the mushrikeen had come, the Messenger of Allah  (ﷺ) marched to Badr, and Badr was a well. We got there before the mushrikeen and we found two of their men, a man from Quraish and a freed slave of “Uqbah bin Abi Mu`ait. As for the Qurashi, he managed to escape, but we caught the freed slave of ‘Uqbah and started asking him: How many are the people? He said: By Allah, they are great in number and powerful. When he said that, the Muslims began to beat him and they brought him to the Prophet (ﷺ), who said: How many are the people? He said: By Allah, they are great in number and powerful. The Prophet (ﷺ) tried hard to make him tell him how many they were, but he refused. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) asked him: How many camels do they slaughter? He said: Ten each day. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: They are one thousand; each camel is for one hundred men. Then a shower of rain fell on us at night and we rushed to seek shelter beneath the trees and leather shields, sheltering from the rain. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) spent the night calling upon his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, saying: “O Allah, if You cause this band to be destroyed, You will never be worshipped.” When dawn came, he called out: `Prayer, O slaves of Allah!” And the people came from beneath the trees and shields and the Messenger of Allah led us in prayer and encouraged us to fight. Then he said: `The army of Quraish is beneath this red outcrop of the mountain.` When the people drew close to us, and we stood in ranks facing one another, we saw one of their men, riding a red camel of his, going around among the people. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `O `Ali, call Hamzah for me` - as he was the closest of them to the mushrikeen - and said `Who is the one on the red camel and what is he saying to them?` Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: `If there is anyone among the people who is enjoining good, then perhaps it is the one on the red camel.` Hamzah came and said: He is `Utbah bin Rabee`ah, and he is telling them not to fight; he is saying to them: O people, I can see people who are going to fight to the death and you will never be able to harm them, because it will cost you too dear to do so. O people, put the blame on me and say: `Utbah bin Rabee`ah is a coward, although you know that I am not the most cowardly among you. Abu Jahl heard that and said: Are you saying this? By Allah, if anyone else said this I would have insulted him; you are filled with fear, ‘Utbah said: Do you mean me, O you with the whistling rear end (i.e., one who breaks wind a great deal because of fear)? Today you will know which of us is the coward. Then ‘Utbah and his brother Shaibah and his son al-Waleed stepped forward in a display of courage and said: Who will come out to fight in single combat? Six young men of the Ansar stepped forward, but `Utbah said: We do not want these; let some of our cousins of Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib come out. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Get up, O Ali, get up, O Hamzah, get up, O `Ubaidah bin al-Harith bin ‘Abdul-Muttalib.` Allah caused `Utbah and Shaibah, the two sons of Rabee`ah, and al-Waleed bin ‘Utbah to be killed and ‘Ubaidah was wounded. We killed seventy of them and captured seventy. A short Ansari man brought al-Abbas bin `Abdul-Muttalib as a captive, and al-`Abbas said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), by Allah, this is not the one who captured me; I was captured by a bold man who was one of the most handsome of people, who was riding a piebald horse, but I do not see him among the people. The Ansari said: I captured him, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: `Be quiet!

He said: `O Allah, if I am a person`s mawla (friend and supporter) then ‘Ali is also his mawla; O Allah, take as friends those who take him as a friend, and take as enemies those who take him as an enemy.”

A hadeeth like that of Abu Ishaq was narrated from `Amr Dhi Murr, i.e., from Sa`eed and Zaid, and he added to it: `and support those who support him, and forsake those who forsake him.`

‘Ali was asked: Did the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) tell you anything that was only for you? He said. He did not tell us anything that was only for us without telling all other people, except that which is in the sheath of this sword of mine. He brought out a document on which it was written: `May Allah curse the one who slaughters in the name of something other than Allah, may Allah curse the one who steals the boundary markers, may Allah curse the one who curses his father and may Allah curse the one who gives refuge to an offender.”;Musnad Ahmad 954, Book 5, Hadith 379;question #6;How does this narration emphasize the universality of the Prophet's (ﷺ) teachings?

Ibraheem declared Makkah to be a sanctuary and I declare Madinah to be a sanctuary; the area between its two lava fields and all of its territory is sacred. It`s grasses are not to be cut, and its game is not to be disturbed, and its lost property is not to be picked up except by the one who announces it, and no tree is to be cut in it, except what a man needs to feed his camel. And no weapon is to be carried in it for fighting.` And in it was said: `All the believers are equal in respect of blood [i.e., their lives are of equal value] . The protection offered by the least among them is to be honoured. They should be united as one against their enemies. A believer is not to be killed (in retaliation) for a disbeliever, nor one who has a covenant during the covenant.";Musnad Ahmad 959, Book 5, Hadith 384;question #6;What does the document say about the carrying of weapons in Madinah?

"I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Were it not that it would be too difficult for my ummah, I would have commanded them to use the siwak every time of prayer, and I would have delayed Isha` until the first third of the night had passed, because when the first third of the night has passed. Allah may he be exalted descends to the first heaven and stays there until dawn comes, and says: Is there any asking so that he might be given? Is there anyone praying so that he might be answered? Is there any sick person asking for healing so that he might be healed? Is there any sinner asking for forgiveness, so that he might be forgiven?


A hadeeth like that of Abu Hurairah was narrated from `Ali bin Abi Talib (رضي الله عنه) from the Prophet (ﷺ) Abi Talib.";Musnad Ahmad 967, 968, Book 5, Hadith 392;question #6;How does the hadith emphasize the importance of seeking forgiveness and healing from Allah?

Abu Sa’eed, the freed slave of Banu Hashim, said: Then he said Al-Hamdu Lillah three times and Allahu Akbar three times, then he said Subhan Allah three times. Then he said: There is no god but You. Then he [the narrator] went back to the hadeeth of Wakee’ and said: Glory be to You, I have wronged myself, so forgive me; no one forgives sins but You.

O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), shouldn`t we rely on our destiny and stop striving? Then whoever is one of the blessed, will end up blessed, and whoever is one of the doomed, will end up doomed. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Rather you should strive, for everyone is helped (to do their deeds): the doomed are helped to do the deeds of the doomed and the blessed are helped to do the deeds of the blessed.` Then he recited: `As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah and fears Him, And believes in Al-Husna.

‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: If I tell you a hadeeth from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), then being thrown down from heaven is dearer to me than telling a lie about him.

He was standing and I did not know which of the two fingers it was. And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  forbade me to use red saddle cloths or to wear garments made from a blend of linen and silk. We said to him: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, what is the red saddle cloth? He said: Something that women make for their husbands to put on their mounts. We said: What are garments made from a blend of linen and silk? He said: Cloth that comes to us from Syria, with wide silken stripes in a twisted shape like citrons.

He took the vessel in his right hand and tilted it over his left hand, then he washed both hands. Then he took the vessel in his right hand and poured water over his left hand, then he washed both hands. He did that three times.ʻAbd Khair said: Throughout that, he did not put his hand in the vessel until he had washed it three times. Then he put his right hand in the vessel and washed his mouth, and rinsed his nose with his left hand. He did that three times. Then he put his right hand in the vessel and washed his face three times. Then he washed his right arm up to the elbow three times, then he washed his left arm up to the elbow three times.

She worked with the millstone until the millstone left marks on her hand, and she brought water with a bucket until the bucket left marks on her chest. She took care of the house until her garment became dusty and she lit a fire under the pot until her garment became dirty, and she suffered hardship because of that. Some female captives (or servants) were brought to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and I said to her: “Go to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and ask him for a servant to relieve you of the hardship you are in.” So she went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and she found some servants with him. Then she came back and did not ask him for one. (And he narrated the hadeeth - And he [the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)] said: `Shall I not tell you of something that is better for you than a servant? When you go to your bed, glorify Allah thirty three times, praise Him thirty three times, and magnify Him thirty four times.” She stuck her head out and said: “I am content with Allah and His Messenger,” twice.

Abu Burdah bin Abi Moosa told me: I was sitting with Abu Moosa when ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) came to us and stood over Abu Moosa and told him to do something concerning the people, `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: `Say O Allah, guide me and correct my aim.’ When you ask for guidance, think of directions when travelling and when you think of proper aim, think of aiming an arrow.” And he forbade me to put my ring on this - and Abu Burdah pointed to his forefinger or middle finger. `Asim said: I am the one who got confused as to which of them he meant - and he forbade me to use red saddle cloths and garments made from a blend of linen and silk, Abu Burdah said: I said to Ameer al-Mu`mineen: What are red saddle cloths and what are garments made from a blend of linen and silk? He said: As for red saddle cloths, that is something that women used to make for their husbands to put on their mounts, And as for garments made from a blend of linen and silk, they were garments that came to us from Syria or Yemen - ` Asim was not sure - which contained silk in a twisted shape like citrons.

"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood at `Arafah and said: `This is the place of standing and all of `Arafah is a place of standing.` Then he put Usamah behind him (on his mount) and moved on at a measured pace on his camel, and the people were urging their camels on, right and left. He did not turn to them, but he said: “Calmly, O people.` Then he came to Jam` and offered two prayers there - i.e., Maghrib and Isha`. Then he stayed there all night, and when morning came he stood at Quzah, and said: `This is Quzah. This is the place of standing and all of Jam’ is a place of standing.` Then he moved on and when he came to Muhassir, he struck his she-camel and she trotted until he crossed the valley, then he reined her in and put al-Fadl behind him (on his mount). He carried on until he came to the Jamrah. He stoned it, then he came to the place of sacrifice and said: “This is the place of sacrifice and all of Mina is a place of sacrifice.` Then a young woman of Khath`am came to him and said: My father is an old man and has become senile; he has lived until Allah made Hajj obligatory. Will it be acceptable if I perform Hajj on his behalf ? He said: `Yes; perform Hajj on behalf of your father.” And he turned al-Fadl`s neck. Al-`Abbas said to him: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), why did you turn the neck of your cousin?

"`Ali (رضي الله عنه) took me by the hand and we set out walking until we sat down on the banks of the Euphrates `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `There is no living soul but Allah has already decreed whether it is doomed or blessed.` A man stood up and said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), why should we strive? He said: `Strive, for each person will be helped to do that for which he was created.” Then he recited this verse: `As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah and fears Him. And believes in Al-Husna, We will make smooth for him the path of ease (goodness). But he who is greedy miser and thinks himself self-sufficient, and belies Al-Husna, We will make smooth for him the path for evil` [Al-Lail 92:5–10].
Al-Husna: The Best (i.e. either La ilaha illAllah : none has the right to be worshipped but Allah) or a reward from Allah (i.e. Allah will compensate him for what he will spend in Allah`s way or bless him with Paradise) [Footnote from Hilali/Khan Translation of the Meanings]";Musnad Ahmad 1349, Book 5, Hadith 749;question #6;What are the consequences of being greedy and self-sufficient in the context of Islamic teachings?

"The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me: “You are like ‘Eesa (in some way); the Jews hated him so much that they made false accusations against his mother, and the Christians loved him so much that they raised him to a status that is not appropriate for him.” Then he said: Two types of men will be doomed because of me: one who loves me and goes to extremes and praises me for that which I do not have, and one who hates me and his hatred of me makes him tell lies against me.";Musnad Ahmad 1376, Book 5, Hadith 775;question #6;How can personal biases affect the way religious teachings are perceived and conveyed?
"I was with the Prophet (ﷺ) and he passed by some palm trees of Madinah, and he saw some people at the top of the palm trees who were pollinating them. He said: “What are these people doing?` [Talhah] said: “They are taking (pollen) from the male and putting it in the female, to fertilise it.” He said: `I do not think this can help in any way.” News of that reached them, so they stopped doing that and came down from the trees, which did not bear any fruit that year as a result. News of that reached the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said: “It was only a thought that crossed my mind. If it helps in any way, then do it. I am only human, just like you, and thoughts may be right or wrong. But if I tell you that Allah, May He be glorified and exalted, said something, I will never tell a lie about Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.”

Someone had come out from Paradise and he gave permission to the one who died last (to enter); then he came out and gave permission to the one who had been martyred. Then they both came back to me and said to me: Go back, for your time has not yet come.” The next morning, Talhah told the people about that and they were amazed by it. News of that reached the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he said: “Why are you amazed?` They said: “O Messenger of Allah, this one strove harder in worship and then was martyred for the sake of Allah, but the other one entered Paradise before him?” He said: `Did he not remain for a year after (the other one) died?” They said: “Yes.” He said: “Did he not live until Ramadan came and fast it?” They said: “Yes.” He said: `Did he not pray this many rak`ahs during that year?` They said: “Yes.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Verily, the distance between them is the distance between heaven and earth.”";Musnad Ahmad 1403, Book 6, Hadith 21;question #6;How does the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) explain the differences in spiritual rewards between two individuals?
I sat with an old man of Banu Tameem in the mosque of Basrah who had a document in his hand. That was at the time of al-Hajjaj. He said to me: “O slave of Allah, do you think that this document could help me in any way with this governor?” I said: “What is this document?” He said: “This is a document from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) which he wrote for us to say that no transgression should be committed against us with regard to our zakah.” I said: “No, by Allah, I do not think that this document will help you at all. But what is the story about this document?” He said: “I came to Madinah with my father when I was a young boy, with some camels of ours to sell. My father was a friend of Talhah bin `Ubaidullah at-Taimi, so we stayed with him. My father said to him: “Come out with me and sell these camels of mine for me.” Talhah said: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has forbidden townsmen to sell for Bedouins. But I will go out with you and sit with you. Offer your camels for sale and if a man comes and makes you an offer and I think he is honest and sincere, I will tell you to sell to him. So we went out to the marketplace and showed the mounts that we had for sale, and Talhah sat nearby. People made offers to us, then when a man offered what we wanted, my father said to Talhah: “Shall I sell to him?” He said: “Yes, I am sure he is honest. So sell to him.” So we sold to him. Then when we took our money and ended our business, my father said to Talhah: “Ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for a document for us, stating that no one should transgress against us with regard to our zakah.” (Talhah) said: “This is your right and it is the right of every Muslim.” He said: “Nevertheless, I would like to have a document from the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ).” So he took us out and brought us to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: “O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), this man is a man of the desert and is a friend of ours. He would like you to write a document for him, stating that no one should transgress against him with regard to his zakah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `That is his right and it is the right of every Muslim.” He said: “O, Messenger of Allah, he would like to have something from you in writing concerning that.” So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote this document for us.”;Musnad Ahmad 1404, Book 6, Hadith 22;question #6;How does this narration illustrate the process of seeking assistance from the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) for personal matters?
"My father az-Zubair (رضي الله عنه) told me that on the day of Uhud, a woman came running, and when she was about to reach where the slain were, the Prophet (ﷺ) did not want her to see them, and he said, `The woman, the woman!` az-Zubair (رضي الله عنه) said: “I thought that she was my mother Safiyyah, so I went running towards her and caught up with her before she reached the slain. She shoved me in the chest, and she was a tough woman.” She said: “Stay away from me, may you have no land!” I said: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is urging you (not to go and see them).” She stopped and took out two pieces of cloth that she had with her and said: “These are two pieces of cloth that I have brought for my brother Hamzah. I have heard that he has been killed; shroud him with them.” We brought the two pieces of cloth to shroud Hamzah with them, but we saw beside him one of the Ansar who had been killed, and the same had been done to him as to Hamzah. We did not feel it was appropriate to shroud Hamzah in two pieces of cloth and to leave the Ansari with no shroud, so we said: “One piece for Hamzah and one piece for the Ansari.” We measured (the pieces of cloth) and found that one of them was larger, so we drew lots between them and shrouded each of them in the piece of cloth that was selected for him.";Musnad Ahmad 1418, Book 7, Hadith 14;question #6;What role did Safiyyah play in providing for her brother Hamzah after his martyrdom?
’Urwah bin az-Zubair told me that az-Zubair (رضي الله عنه) used to narrate that he referred to the Prophet (ﷺ), a dispute with an Ansari man who had been present at Badr about the streams of the Harrah, with which they both used to irrigate their palm trees. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to az-Zubair (رضي الله عنه): `Water (your trees), then let the water flow to your neighbour.` The Ansari got angry and said: “O Messenger of Allah, it is because he is your cousin!” The face of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) changed colour, then he said to az-Zubair: “Water (your trees), then block the water until it backs up to the bottom of the wall.” So the Prophet (ﷺ)  told az-Zubair (رضي الله عنه) to take all of his rights in full. Before that, the Prophet (ﷺ) had suggested to az-Zubair (رضي الله عنه) something that would be good for both him and the Ansari, but when the Ansari annoyed the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he told az-Zubair to take his rights in full in a clear ruling. `Urwah said: “az-Zubair (رضي الله عنه) said: By Allah, I think that this verse was revealed concerning that: But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad (ﷺ)) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission` (an-Nisa` [4:65]).”;Musnad Ahmad 1419, Book 7, Hadith 15;question #6;How does this event relate to the Quranic verse about having faith in the Prophet's (ﷺ) decisions?
"“There has come to you the disease of the nations before you, jealousy and hatred. Hatred is the `shaver` (destroyer). I do not say that it shaves hair; rather its shaves (destroys) religious commitment. By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, you will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another. Shall I not tell you of something that will help you to achieve that? Spread (the greeting of) salaam amongst yourselves.`

It was narrated from Ya`eesh bin al-Waleed that a freed slave of the family of az-Zubair told him that az-Zubair (رضي الله عنه) told him: The Prophet (ﷺ)  said: “There has come to you.” and he narrated it.
